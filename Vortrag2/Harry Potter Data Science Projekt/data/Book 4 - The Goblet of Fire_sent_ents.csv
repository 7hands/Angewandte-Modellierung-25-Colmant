moves.",['Ron']

name on the back, and imagined the sensation of 
hearing a hundred-thousand-strong crowd roar, as 
Ludo Bagman’s voice echoed throughout the stadium,

dropped off to sleep — his fantasies of flying like 
Krum might well have slipped into actual dreams —

Obedient to Sirius’s wish of hearing about anything 
odd at Hogwarts, Harry sent him a letter by brown 
owl that night, explaining all about Mr. Crouch 
breaking into Snape’s office, and Moody and Snape’s 
conversation.","['Snape', 'Mr.']"
"Ron quite liked the idea of using the Summoning 
Charm again — Harry had explained about Aqua- 
Lungs, and Ron couldn’t see why Harry shouldn’t 
",['Ron']
"However, though he, Ron, and 
Hermione searched through their lunchtimes, 
evenings, and whole weekends — though Harry asked 
Professor McGonagall for a note of permission to use 
the Restricted Section, and even asked the irritable, 
vulture-like librarian, Madam Pince, for help — they 
found nothing whatsoever that would enable Harry to 
spend an hour underwater and live to tell the tale. 

","['Ron', 'McGonagall']"
"He had been so 
intent on telling Sirius all about Snape and Moody he 
had completely forgotten to mention the egg’s clue. 

",['Snape']
"“What’s he want to know about the next Hogsmeade 
weekend for?” said Ron. 

“Dunno,” said Harry dully.",['Ron']
"Whether Hagrid was trying to make up for the Blast- 
Ended Skrewts, or because there were now only two 
skrewts left, or because he was trying to prove he 
could do anything that Professor Grubbly-Plank 
could, Harry didn’t know, but Hagrid had been 
continuing her lessons on unicorns ever since he’d 
returned to work.",['Hagrid']
"It turned out that Hagrid knew 
quite as much about unicorns as he did about 
monsters, though it was clear that he found their lack 
of poisonous fangs disappointing. 

",['Hagrid']
"Parvati and Lavender went into transports of delight 
at the sight of them, and even Pansy Parkinson had 
to work hard to conceal how much she liked them. 

",['Parkinson']
"“Easier ter spot than the adults,” Hagrid told the 
class.",['Hagrid']
"Hagrid muttered, moving aside 
slightly, while most of the others swarmed around the 
baby unicorns. 

",['Hagrid']
"“Jus’ nervous, eh?” said Hagrid. 

",['Hagrid']
"“Harry,” said Hagrid, clapping a massive hand on his 
shoulder, so that Harry’s knees buckled under its 
weight, “I’d’ve bin worried before I saw yeh take on 
tha’ Horntail, but I know now yeh can do anythin’ yeh 
set yer mind ter.",['Hagrid']
"He looked up at Hagrid — perhaps he had to go into 
the lake sometimes, to deal with the creatures in it? 
",['Hagrid']
"He looked after everything else on the grounds, after 
all — 

“Yeh’re goin’ ter win,” Hagrid growled, patting Harry’s 
shoulder again, so that Harry actually felt himself 
sink a couple of inches into the soft ground.",['Hagrid']
"Harry just couldn’t bring himself to wipe the happy, 
confident smile off Hagrid ’s face.",['Hagrid']
"He sat with Hermione and Ron in the library as the 
sun set outside, tearing feverishly through page after 
page of spells, hidden from one another by the 
massive piles of books on the desk in front of each of 
them.",['Ron']
"“I don’t reckon it can be done,” said Ron’s voice flatly 
from the other side of the table.",['Ron']
"“They have,” said Ron.",['Ron']

you wanted!” said Ron.

got to register yourself with the Improper Use of Magic 
Office ...",['McGonagall']

stomach drop.",['Ron']

Ron and Hermione off?","['McGonagall', 'Ron']"
"“Well meet you back in the common room,” Hermione 
told Harry as she got up to go with Ron — both of 
them looked very anxious.",['Ron']
"People kept wishing him luck for the 
next morning in cheery, confident voices like Hagrid’s, 
all of them apparently convinced that he was about to 
pull off another stunning performance like the one he 
had managed in the first task.",['Hagrid']
"He had 
searched all the remaining books, and Ron and 
Hermione had not come back. 

",['Ron']
"He saw Malfoy 
flashing his POTTER STINKS badge at the front of the 
crowd, saw Hagrid’s crestfallen, disbelieving face.","['Hagrid', 'Malfoy']"

Professor Moody in the staffroom, talking about the 
next task. . . .",['McGonagall']

judges’ table — Mr. Crouch had failed to turn up 
again.

Madame Maxime didn’t look at all pleased to see him.

champions, merpeople, Ron — nor, thankfully, the 
giant squid.

binding Ron, and after several minutes’ hard work, 
they broke apart.",['Ron']
"Ron floated, unconscious,",['Ron']
"Would he have time to take Ron to the surface and 
come back down for Hermione and the others?",['Ron']
"He snatched up the stone, which Krum had dropped, 
but the mermen now closed in around Ron and the 
little girl, shaking their heads at him.",['Ron']
"He seized the little girl 
around the waist, grabbed the neck of Ron’s robes, 
and kicked off from the bottom. 

",['Ron']
"He could no longer use his 
webbed hands to propel himself forward; he worked 
his flippers furiously, but Ron and Fleur’s sister were 
like potato-filled sacks dragging him back down. ... 

",['Ron']
"Harry’s legs were seizing up 
with the effort to keep swimming; his shoulders were 
aching horribly with the effort of dragging Ron and 
the girl.",['Ron']
"And then he felt his head break the surface of the 
lake; wonderful, cold, clear air was making his wet 
face sting; he gulped it down, feeling as though he 
had never breathed properly before, and, panting, 
pulled Ron and the little girl up with him.",['Ron']

were wrong ... both of them had opened their eyes; 
the girl looked scared and confused, but Ron merely 
expelled a great spout of water, blinked in the bright 
light, turned to Harry, and said, “Wet, this, isn’t it?”

"“Harry, you prat,” said Ron, “you didn’t take that song 
thing seriously, did you?",['Ron']

let any of us drown!” 

",['Dumbledore']
"“The song said — ” 

“It was only to make sure you got back inside the time 
limit!” said Ron.",['Ron']
"It was all very 
well for Ron; he’d been asleep, he hadn’t felt how 
eerie it was down in the lake, surrounded by spear- 
carrying merpeople who’d looked more than capable 
of murder.

Bagman stood beaming at Harry and Ron from the

very white and somehow much younger than usual, 
came splashing out to meet them.","['Ron', 'Dumbledore']"

bank (“Gerroff, Percy, I’m all right!”); Dumbledore and 
Bagman were pulling Harry upright; Fleur had broken 
free of Madame Maxime and was hugging her sister.

"He was the only judge who had not left the table; 
the only judge not showing signs of pleasure and 
relief that Harry, Ron, and Fleur’s sister had got back 
safely.",['Ron']
"Now he was 
out of the water, it seemed perfectly clear that 
Dumbledore’s safety precautions wouldn’t have 
permitted the death of a hostage just because their 
champion hadn’t turned up.",['Dumbledore']
"Why hadn’t he just 
grabbed Ron and gone?",['Ron']
"Dumbledore was crouching at the water’s edge, deep 
in conversation with what seemed to be the chief 
merperson, a particularly wild and ferocious-looking 
female.",['Dumbledore']
"He was making the same sort of screechy 
noises that the merpeople made when they were 
above water; clearly, Dumbledore could speak 
Mermish.",['Dumbledore']
"Madam Pomfrey had 
gone to rescue Ron from Percy’s clutches; she led him 
over to Harry and the others, gave him a blanket and 
some Pepperup Potion, then went to fetch Fleur and 
her sister.",['Ron']
"Fleur bent down, kissed Harry twice on each cheek 
(he felt his face burn and wouldn’t have been 
surprised if steam was coming out of his ears again), 
then said to Ron, “And you too — you ’elped — ” 

“Yeah,” said Ron, looking extremely hopeful, “yeah, a 
bit — ” 



Fleur swooped down on him too and kissed him. 
",['Ron']
"However, the Merchieftainess 
informs us that Mr. Potter was first to reach the 
hostages, and that the delay in his return was due to 
his determination to return all hostages to safety, not 
merely his own.”

half-commiserating looks.

Potter’s score is forty-five points.”

One of the best things about the aftermath of the 
second task was that everybody was very keen to hear 
details of what had happened down in the lake, which 
meant that Ron was getting to share Harry’s limelight 
for once.",['Ron']
"Harry noticed that Ron’s version of events 
changed subtly with every retelling.",['Ron']
"At first, he gave 
what seemed to be the truth; it tallied with 
Hermione’s story, anyway — Dumbledore had put all 
the hostages into a bewitched sleep in Professor 
McGonagall’s office, first assuring them that they 
would be quite safe, and would awake when they were 
back above the water.","['McGonagall', 'Dumbledore']"
"One week later, however, Ron 
was telling a thrilling tale of kidnap in which he 
struggled single-handedly against fifty heavily armed 
merpeople who had to beat him into submission 
before tying him up. 

",['Ron']
"“But I had my wand hidden up my sleeve,” he assured 
Padma Patil, who seemed to be a lot keener on Ron 
now that he was getting so much attention and was 
making a point of talking to him every time they

"Ron’s ears went red, and thereafter, he reverted to the 
bewitched sleep version of events.

"“He hasn’t come back to Hogsmeade?” said Ron 
incredulously.

"“I can’t believe him,” said Harry tensely, “if he’s 
caught ...”

“Made it so far, though, hasn’t he?” said Ron.",['Ron']
"Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were standing in a huddle 
outside the classroom door with Pansy Parkinson’s 
gang of Slytherin girls.","['Parkinson', 'Malfoy']"
"Pansy’s pug-like face peered excitedly around Goyle ’s 
broad back as Harry, Ron, and Hermione approached. 

",['Ron']
"At that moment, the dungeon door opened, 
and Snape beckoned them all inside. 

",['Snape']
"Hermione, Harry, and Ron headed for a table at the 
back of the dungeon as usual.",['Ron']
"Once Snape had 
turned his back on them to write up the ingredients 
of today’s potion on the blackboard, Hermione hastily 
rifled through the magazine under the desk.",['Snape']
Harry and Ron leaned in closer.,['Ron']
"Miss Granger, a plain but ambitious girl, seems to 
have a taste for famous wizards that Harry alone 
cannot satisfy.",['Miss Granger']
"Since the arrival at Hogwarts of Viktor 
Krum, Bulgarian Seeker and hero of the last World 
Quidditch Cup, Miss Granger has been toying with 
both boys’ affections.",['Miss Granger']
"Krum, who is openly smitten 
with the devious Miss Granger, has already invited 
her to visit him in Bulgaria over the summer holidays, 
and insists that he has “never felt this way about any 
other girl.”

"However, it might not be Miss Granger’s doubtful 
natural charms that have captured these unfortunate 
boys’ interest. 

",['Miss Granger']
"“She’s really ugly,” says Pansy Parkinson, a pretty 
and vivacious fourth-year student, “but she’d be well 
up to making a Love Potion, she’s quite brainy.",['Parkinson']
"Love Potions are, of course, banned at Hogwarts, and 
no doubt Albus Dumbledore will want to investigate 
these claims.",['Dumbledore']
"Ron hissed at Hermione as she stared 
down at the article.",['Ron']
"she repeated, 
shaking with suppressed giggles as she looked 
around at Ron. 

",['Ron']
"“It’s what my mum calls them,” Ron muttered, his 
ears going red. 

",['Ron']
"Hermione gave 
them a sarcastic smile and a wave, and she, Harry, 
and Ron started unpacking the ingredients they 
would need for their Wit-Sharpening Potion. 

",['Ron']
“Known what?” said Ron quickly.,['Ron']
"Hermione blushed scarlet as she said this and 
determinedly avoided Ron’s eyes.

“What?” said Ron, dropping his pestle with a loud 
clunk. 



",['Ron']
"“And what did you say?” said Ron, who had picked up 
his pestle and was grinding it on the desk, a good six 
inches from his bowl, because he was looking at 
Hermione. 

",['Ron']
"Ron repeated, pounding his 
pestle down so hard that it dented the desk. 

",['Ron']
"“Well, I was too busy seeing whether you and Harry 
were okay to — ” 

“Fascinating though your social life undoubtedly is, 
Miss Granger,” said an icy voice right behind them, 
and all three of them jumped, “I must ask you not to 
discuss it in my class.",['Miss Granger']

talking.",['Snape']

STINKS across the dungeon at Harry.

Snape added, snatching up the copy of Witch Weekly. 
",['Snape']

Rita Skeeter’s article.",['Snape']

an unpleasant smile curled Snape’s thin mouth.",['Snape']
"Snape was pausing 
at the end of every sentence to allow the Slytherins a 
hearty laugh.",['Snape']
"The article sounded ten times worse 
when read by Snape.",['Snape']

magazine to continued gales of laughter from the 
Slytherins.",['Snape']

beside Miss Parkinson.","['Miss Granger', 'Miss', 'Parkinson']"

at his desk and watched Harry unload his cauldron.

mashing of his scarab beetles, imagining each one to 
have Snape’s face.

“All this press attention seems to have inflated your 
already over-large head, Potter,” said Snape quietly, 
once the rest of the class had settled down again. 

",['Snape']
"He knew Snape was trying to 
provoke him; he had done this before.",['Snape']
"“You might be laboring under the delusion that the 
entire wizarding world is impressed with you,” Snape 
went on, so quietly that no one else could hear him

though he had already reduced them to a very fine 
powder), “but I don’t care how many times your 
picture appears in the papers.",['Snape']

were shaking slightly out of anger, but he kept his 
eyes down, as though he couldn’t hear what Snape 
was saying to him.

"“So I give you fair warning, Potter,” Snape continued 
in a softer and more dangerous voice, “pint-sized 
celebrity or not — if I catch you breaking into my 
office one more time — ” 

“I haven’t been anywhere near your office!” said Harry 
angrily, forgetting his feigned deafness.

eyes boring into Harry’s.",['Snape']

or to look guilty.",['Snape']
"In truth, he hadn’t stolen either of 
these things from Snape.",['Snape']

boomslang skin back in their second year — they had 
needed it for the Polyjuice Potion — and while Snape 
had suspected Harry at the time, he had never been 
able to prove it.",['Snape']

Snape’s eyes flashed.,['Snape']
"For one wild moment, Harry 
thought Snape was about to pull out his wand and 
curse him — then he saw that Snape had drawn out a 
small crystal bottle of a completely clear potion.",['Snape']
"Snape said, his 
eyes glittering dangerously again. 

",['Snape']
"“It is Veritaserum — a Truth Potion so powerful that 
three drops would have you spilling your innermost 
secrets for this entire class to hear,” said Snape 
viciously.",['Snape']
"He didn’t like the sound of that 
Truth Potion at all, nor would he put it past Snape to 
slip him some.",['Snape']
"He repressed a shudder at the thought 
of what might come spilling out of his mouth if Snape 
did it . . .",['Snape']

as he walked up toward Snape ’s desk.",['Snape']

had reached Snape.",['Snape']

“I’ll talk to you after my lesson, Karkaroff,” Snape 
muttered, but Karkaroff interrupted him.

",['Snape']
"Karkaroff looked extremely worried, and Snape looked 
angry.

"Karkaroff hovered behind Snape ’s desk for the rest of 
the double period.",['Snape']

Snape from slipping away at the end of class.",['Snape']

edge of his cauldron, saw Karkaroff pull up the left- 
hand sleeve of his robe and show Snape something on 
his inner forearm.
