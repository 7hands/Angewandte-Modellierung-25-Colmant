THE MAN WITH TWO FACES 

It was Quirrell. 

",['Quirrell']
Quirrell smiled.,['Quirrell']
"“But I thought — Snape — ” 

“Severus?”",['Snape']
"Quirrell laughed, and it wasn’t his usual 
quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp.",['Quirrell']
"Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st- 
stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?” 

",['Quirrell']
"“But Snape tried to kill me!” 

",['Snape']
"Your friend Miss 
Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed 
to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match.",['Snape']
"I’d have managed 
it before then if Snape hadn’t been muttering a 
countercurse, trying to save you.” 

",['Snape']
"“Snape was trying to save me?” 

",['Snape']
"“Of course,” said Quirrell coolly.",['Quirrell']
"I couldn’t do anything with 
Dumbledore watching.",['Dumbledore']
"All the other teachers thought 
Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he 
did make himself unpopular . . .",['Snape']
Quirrell snapped his fingers.,['Quirrell']
"Unfortunately, while everyone else was 
running around looking for it, Snape, who already 
suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head 
me off — and not only did my troll fail to beat you to 
death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to 
bite Snape ’s leg off properly. 



",['Snape']
"It was only then that Harry realized what was 
standing behind Quirrell.",['Quirrell']
"“This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell 
murmured, tapping his way around the frame.",['Quirrell']
"“Trust 
Dumbledore to come up with something like this . . . 
",['Dumbledore']
"All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell 
talking and stop him from concentrating on the 
mirror. 

",['Quirrell']
"“I saw you and Snape in the forest — ” he blurted out. 

",['Snape']
"“Yes,” said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to 
look at the back.",['Quirrell']
"...” 

Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and 
stared hungrily into it. 

",['Quirrell']
"He had to keep Quirrell from giving 
his whole attention to the mirror. 

",['Quirrell']
"“But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.” 

",['Snape']
"“Oh, he does,” said Quirrell casually, “heavens, yes. 
",['Quirrell']
"“But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing — I thought 
Snape was threatening you. 

",['Snape']
"For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across 
Quirrell’s face. 

",['Quirrell']
"“He is with me wherever I go,” said Quirrell quietly.",['Quirrell']

"...” 

Quirrell’s voice trailed away.",['Quirrell']
"He’d seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken 
hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron. 

",['Quirrell']
"Quirrell cursed under his breath. 

",['Quirrell']
"What I want more than anything else in the world at 
the moment, he thought, is to find the Stone before 
Quirrell does.",['Quirrell']
"But how can I look without Quirrell realizing 
what I’m up to? 

",['Quirrell']
"He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass 
without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his 
ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over.",['Quirrell']
"Quirrell 
ignored him.",['Quirrell']
"And to Harry’s horror, a voice answered, and the voice 
seemed to come from Quirrell himself. 

",['Quirrell']
"Quirrell rounded on Harry. 

",['Quirrell']
"“Come here,” Quirrell repeated.",['Quirrell']

the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell’s

invented.",['Dumbledore']
"Quirrell cursed again. 

",['Quirrell']
"But he hadn’t walked five paces before a high voice 
spoke, though Quirrell wasn’t moving his lips. 

",['Quirrell']
Quirrell shouted.,['Quirrell']
"Petrified, he 
watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap 
his turban.",['Quirrell']
"Quirrell’s head looked strangely small without it. 

",['Quirrell']
"Where there should have been a back to 
Quirrell’s head, there was a face, the most terrible 
face Harry had ever seen.",['Quirrell']

forest ... and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be 
able to create a body of my own. ...",['Quirrell']

Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that 
Voldemort could still see him.",['Quirrell']
"and the next second, Harry 
felt Quirrell’s hand close on his wrist.",['Quirrell']
"At once, a 
needle-sharp pain seared across Harry’s scar; his 
head felt as though it was about to split in two; he 
yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his 
surprise, Quirrell let go of him.",['Quirrell']
"The pain in his head 
lessened — he looked around wildly to see where 
Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, 
looking at his fingers — they were blistering before his 
eyes. 

",['Quirrell']
"SEIZE HIM!” shrieked Voldemort again, 
and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, 
landing on top of him, both hands around Harry’s 
neck —",['Quirrell']
"Harry’s scar was almost blinding him with 
pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony. 

",['Quirrell']
"And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground 
with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, 
bewildered, at his own palms — Harry could see they 
looked burned, raw, red, and shiny. 



",['Quirrell']
"Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, 
but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed 
Quirrell’s face — 

“AAAARGH!” 

",['Quirrell']
"Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and 
then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn’t touch his bare 
skin, not without suffering terrible pain — his only 
chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in 
enough pain to stop him from doing a curse. 

",['Quirrell']
"Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, 
and hung on as tight as he could.",['Quirrell']
"Quirrell screamed 
and tried to throw Harry off — the pain in Harry’s 
head was building — he couldn’t see — he could only 
hear Quirrell’s terrible shrieks and Voldemort’s yells 
of, “KILL HIM!",['Quirrell']
"He felt Quirrell’s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew 
all was lost, and fell into blackness, down ... down ... 
down ...

Dumbledore swam into view above him.
