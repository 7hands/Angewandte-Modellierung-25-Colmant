many years to come!",['Flitwick']

Summoning Charms, which according to Professor

barklike face in which a pair of beetle-brown eyes 
glittered.

irritating Harry: Anyone would have thought that

enough, and the Blast-Ended Skrewts perhaps too 
much so.

"Dear Ron, 

I have only just heard (from no less a person than the 
Minister of Magic himself, who has it from your new 
teacher, Professor Umbridge) that you have become a 
Hogwarts prefect 

I was most pleasantly surprised when I heard this 
news and must firstly offer my congratulations.","['Ron', 'Umbridge']"

I want to give you some advice, which is why I am 
sending this at night rather than by the usual morning 
post",['Ron']

could put you in danger of losing your badge more than 
continued fraternization with that boy.",['Ron']
"Yes, I am sure 
you are surprised to hear this — no doubt you will say 
that Potter has always been Dumbledore’s favorite — 
but I feel bound to tell you that Dumbledore may not be 
in charge at Hogwarts much longer and the people who 
count have a very different — and probably more 
accurate — view of Potters behavior.",['Dumbledore']
"Seriously, Ron, you do not want to be tarred with the 
same brush as Potter, it could be very damaging to 
your future prospects, and I am talking here about life 
after school too.",['Ron']
"I know that he can be unbalanced and, for all I 
know, violent — but if you have any worries about this,

or have spotted anything else in Potter’s behavior that 
is troubling you, I urge you to speak to Dolores 
Umbridge, a really delightful woman, who I know will 
be only too happy to advise you.

hinted above, Dumbledore’s regime at Hog warts may 
soon be over.",['Dumbledore']

but to the school and the Ministry.",['Ron']
"I am very sorry to 
hear that so far Professor Umbridge is encountering 
very little cooperation from staff as she strives to make 
those necessary changes within Hogwarts that the 
Ministry so ardently desires (although she should find 
this easier from next week — again, see the Prophet 
tomorrow!).",['Umbridge']
"I shall say only this — a student who 
shows himself willing to help Professor Umbridge now 
may be very well placed for Head Boy ship in a couple 
of years!

"It pains me to criticize our parents, but I 
am afraid I can no longer live under their roof while 
they remain mixed up with the dangerous crowd 
around Dumbledore (if you are writing to Mother at any 
point, you might tell her that a certain Sturgis Podmore, 
who is a great friend of Dumbledore’s, has recently 
been sent to Azkaban for trespass at the Ministry.

"I count myself very lucky to have escaped 
the stigma of association with such people — the 
Minister really could not be more gracious to me — and 
I do hope, Ron, that you will not allow family ties to 
blind you to the misguided nature of our parents’ 
beliefs and actions either.",['Ron']

him strange, even mad; he knew that the Daily 
Prophet had been making snide allusions to him for 
months, but there was something about seeing it 
written down like that in Percy’s writing, about 
knowing that Percy was advising Ron to drop him and 
even to tell tales on him to Umbridge, that made his 
situation real to him as nothing else had.","['Ron', 'Umbridge']"

writing back to Ron, “and then copy out this 
conclusion that I’ve written for you.”

quickly, “We’ll tell you afterward, go on, Sirius.”

Voldemort was feeling a powerful emotion,” said 
Harry, ignoring, as usual, Ron and Hermione ’s 
winces.","['Ron', 'Dumbledore']"

Umbridge touching me when I was in detention with 
her?”",['Umbridge']

I’m sure she’s no Death Eater — ”

remembering Umbridge’s comments about dangerous 
half-breeds during her first lesson.

further.

Dumbledore’s doing — forming his own private army, 
with which he will be able to take on the Ministry of 
Magic.”

stupidest thing I’ve ever heard, including all the stuff 
that Luna Lovegood comes out with.”

stop at nothing to seize power.",['Dumbledore']

parchment and talking much louder than was 
necessary so that they could hear every word.

"“Well,” said Harry, recovering quickly from this 
unpleasant surprise, “a few more accidents like that 
and the game’s in the bag, isn’t it?” 

Hermione and Ginny sat down opposite them wearing 
red-and-gold scarves, gloves, and rosettes.

just got to have some breakfast.”

was not capable of eating anything more and Harry

rooms.",['Ron']
"“Don’t let Ron see what’s on those Slytherins’ 
badges,” she whispered urgently.

"“And you, Harry — ” 

Ron seemed to come to himself slightly as they 
walked back across the Great Hall.",['Ron']
"He seemed too distracted to 
notice much around him, but Harry cast a curious 
glance at the crown-shaped badges as they passed 
the Slytherin table, and this time he made out the 
words etched onto them: 

WEASLEY 

IS OUR KING

nothing good, he hurried Ron across the entrance 
hall, down the stone steps, and out into the icy air.

pouring out of the castle toward the pitch.

about them — ” 

“We do,” said Harry and Ron together.

"He was starting to feel nervous, but he 
knew his butterflies were as nothing to Ron’s, who 
was clutching his stomach and staring straight ahead 
again, his jaw set and his complexion pale gray.

"Malfoy stood to one 
side, the sunlight gleaming on his white-blond head. 
",['Malfoy']
"The balls were released and the fourteen players shot 
upward; out of the corner of his eye Harry saw Ron 
streak off toward the goal hoops.",['Ron']
"He zoomed higher, 
dodging a Bludger, and set off on a wide lap of the 
pitch, gazing around for a glint of gold; on the other 
side of the stadium, Draco Malfoy was doing exactly 
the same.

"yelled Professor McGonagall. 

",['McGonagall']
"— SHE 
SHOOTS — SHE — aaaah ...” 

Bletchley, the Slytherin Keeper, had saved the goal; 
he threw the Quaffle to Warrington who sped off with 
it, zigzagging in between Alicia and Katie; the singing 
from below grew louder and louder as he drew nearer 
and nearer Ron — 

Weasley is our King, 

Weasley is our King, 

He always lets the Quaffle in, 

Weasley is our King. 



",['Ron']
"Page | 521Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Harry could not help himself: Abandoning his search 
for the Snitch, he turned his Firebolt toward Ron, a 
lone figure at the far end of the pitch, hovering before 
the three goal hoops while the massive Warrington 
pelted toward him ... 

“ — and it’s Warrington with the Quaffle, Warrington 
heading for goal, he’s out of Bludger range with just 
the Keeper ahead — ” 

A great swell of song rose from the Slytherin stands 
below: 

Weasley cannot save a thing, 

He cannot block a single ring . . . 

",['Ron']
"“ — so it’s the first test for new Gryffindor Keeper, 
Weasley, brother of Beaters, Fred and George, and a 
promising new talent on the team — come on, Ron!” 

",['Ron']
"But the scream of delight came from the Slytherin 
end: Ron had dived wildly, his arms wide, and the 
Quaffle had soared between them, straight through 
Ron’s central hoop. 

",['Ron']
"“So that’s ten-nil 
to Slytherin — bad luck, Ron ...” 

",['Ron']
"There was no sign of the Snitch anywhere he looked; 
Malfoy was still circling the stadium just like Harry. 
",['Malfoy']
"They passed midway around the pitch going in 
opposite directions and Harry heard Malfoy singing 
loudly, 

WEASLEY WAS BORN IN A BIN . . .

"Harry zoomed around the end of the stadium behind 
the Slytherin goal hoops, willing himself not to look at

what was going on at Ron’s end; as he sped past the 
Slytherin Keeper, he heard Bletchley singing along 
with the crowd below,

"“ — and Pucey’s dodged Alicia again, and he’s heading 
straight for goal, stop it, Ron!”

Pansy Parkinson right at the front of the stands, her 
back to the pitch as she conducted the Slytherin 
supporters who were roaring: 

THAT’S WHY SLYTHERINS ALL SING: 

WEASLEY IS OUR KING. 

",['Parkinson']
But Ron let in two more goals.,['Ron']
"Harry ducked a Bludger that Crabbe had 
sent rocketing in his direction and resumed his 
frantic scouring of the pitch for the Snitch, keeping 
one eye on Malfoy in case he showed signs of having 
spotted it, but Malfoy, like him, was continuing to 
soar around the stadium, searching fruitlessly . . . 

",['Malfoy']
"In a matter of seconds, Malfoy was streaking out of 
the sky on Harry’s left, a green-and-silver blur lying 
flat on his broom... 

",['Malfoy']
"The Snitch skirted the foot of one of the goal hoops 
and scooted off toward the other side of the stands; 
its change of direction suited Malfoy, who was nearer.

now neck and neck . . .

his broom, stretching toward the Snitch ... to his 
right, Malfoy’s arm extended too, reaching, groping ... 

",['Malfoy']
"It was over in two breathless, desperate, windswept 
seconds — Harry’s fingers closed around the tiny, 
struggling ball — Malfoy’s fingernails scrabbled the 
back of Harry’s hand hopelessly — Harry pulled his 
broom upward, holding the struggling ball in his 
hand and the Gryffindor spectators screamed their 
approval...

those goals, nobody would remember as long as 
Gryffindor had won —

five or six feet above the ground, having dived so low 
to catch the Snitch, but he was winded all the same 
as he landed flat on his back on the frozen pitch.",['Ron']
"Page | 526Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling 




Harry heard a snort from behind him and turned 
around, still holding the Snitch tightly in his hand: 
Draco Malfoy had landed close by; white-faced with 
fury, he was still managing to sneer. 

",['Malfoy']
"Harry did not answer; he turned away to meet the 
rest of the team who were now landing one by one, 
yelling and punching the air in triumph, all except 
Ron, who had dismounted from his broom over by the 
goalposts and was making his way slowly back to the 
changing rooms alone.

called, as Katie and Alicia hugged Harry.",['Malfoy']
"“But we 
couldn’t find rhymes for fat and ugly — we wanted to 
sing about his mother, see — ” 

“Talk about sour grapes,” said Angelina, casting 
Malfoy a disgusted look. 

",['Malfoy']

father, you know — ”

about.",['Malfoy']

Muggles even the Weasleys’ hovel smells okay — ” 

Harry grabbed hold of George; meanwhile it was 
taking the combined efforts of Angelina, Alicia, and 
Katie to stop Fred leaping on Malfoy, who was 
laughing openly.",['Malfoy']
"“Or perhaps,” said Malfoy, leering as he backed away, 
“you can remember what your mother’s house stank 
like, Potter, and Weasley’s pigsty reminds you of it — ” 

Harry was not aware of releasing George, all he knew 
was that a second later both of them were sprinting at 
Malfoy.",['Malfoy']
"He had completely forgotten the fact that all 
the teachers were watching: All he wanted to do was 
cause Malfoy as much pain as possible.",['Malfoy']
"With no time 
to draw out his wand, he merely drew back the fist 
clutching the Snitch and sank it as hard as he could 
into Malfoy’s stomach — 

“Harry! HARRY!",['Malfoy']
"He could hear girls’ voices screaming, Malfoy yelling, 
George swearing, a whistle blowing, and the bellowing 
of the crowd around him, but he did not care, not 
until somebody in the vicinity yelled “ IMPEDIMENTA !” 
and only when he was knocked over backward by the 
force of the spell did he abandon the attempt to 
punch every inch of Malfoy he could reach...

"Malfoy was curled up on the ground, whimpering and

moaning, his nose bloody; George was sporting a 
swollen lip; Fred was still being forcibly restrained by 
the three Chasers, and Crabbe was cackling in the 
background.",['Malfoy']
"Harry became aware that something was 
still struggling in his right hand, the knuckles of 
which he had bruised against Malfoy’s jaw; looking 
down he saw the Snitch’s silver wings protruding 
from between his fingers, struggling for release.

"They had barely reached the door of Professor 
McGonagall’s office when she came marching along 
the corridor behind them.",['McGonagall']

the floor with Ginger Newts.",['McGonagall']

Invisibility Cloak and the Marauder’s Map from his

themselves hastily in the cloak — Ron had grown so

clearer view of Harry.",['Ron']

breaking off when Hermione caught his eye.

over the rug.",['Ron']

curiosity and hilarity to Hermione’s slight frown, and 
nodded.

went into a raucous peal of laughter that made 
several timid-looking second years over beside the 
window jump.",['Ron']

face as he watched Ron rolling around on the 
hearthrug.",['Ron']

point of her quill into her ink pot, “you are the most 
insensitive wart I have ever had the misfortune to 
meet.”

indignantly.",['Ron']

at once, they’d explode.”

wouldn’t’ve — she just sort of came at me — and next

do — ”

trailing on the floor.",['Ron']

silence for another twenty minutes, Ron finishing his 
Transfiguration essay with many snorts of impatience

more than anything that Sirius’s head would appear 
there and give him some advice about girls.",['Ron']

movement, “I take it Dilys will have seen him arrive, 
then — ”

reappeared in her picture too; she sank, coughing, 
into her armchair and said, “Yes, they’ve taken him to

with his insides aching with hunger, and Ron snoring 
in the next bed.",['Ron']
"Squinting around the room he saw 
the dark outline of Phineas Nigellus standing again in 
his portrait and it occurred to Harry that Dumbledore

there",['Ron']

getting used to it...”

you’ve been hiding ever since we got back — ” 

“I didn’t want anyone to talk to me,” said Harry, who 
was feeling more and more nettled. 

",['Ginny']

angrily, “seeing as you don’t know anyone but me

tell you how it feels.”

presents at the foot of his bed and Ron already 
halfway through opening his own, rather larger, pile.

books entitled Practical Defensive Magic and Its Use 
Against the Dark Arts, which had superb, moving 
color illustrations of all the counterjinxes and hexes it 
described.",['Lupin']
"Harry flicked through the first volume 
eagerly; he could see it was going to be highly useful 
in his plans for the D.A. Hagrid had sent a furry 
brown wallet that had fangs, which were presumably 
supposed to be an antitheft device, but unfortunately 
prevented Harry putting any money in without getting 
his fingers ripped off.",['Hagrid']
"Tonks’s present was a small, 
working model of a Firebolt, which Harry watched fly 
around the room, wishing he still had his full-size 
version; Ron had given him an enormous box of 
Every-Flavor Beans; Mr. and Mrs. Weasley the usual 
hand-knitted jumper and some mince pies; and 
Dobby, a truly dreadful painting that Harry suspected 
had been done by the elf himself.","['Ron', 'Mr.']"
"“Why not?” said Ron.

unusual, Ron.”

over to a dingy door in the corner opposite the pantry

no reply.

might be shattered, but still the little black-and-white 
people inside them peered haughtily up at him,

dark, heavy-lidded woman whose trial he had 
witnessed in Dumbledore’s Pensieve: Bellatrix 
Lestrange.",['Dumbledore']

from the bed and over to the werewolf, who had no 
visitors and was looking rather wistfully at the crowd 
around Mr. Weasley; Bill muttered something about 
getting himself a cup of tea and Fred and George leapt 
up to accompany him, grinning.

Muggle remedies?”

door with him.","['Ron', 'Ginny']"

medieval wizard called out that he clearly had a bad

slightly guilty.",['Ron']

that had damaged Professor Lockhart’s memory so 
badly that he had landed here in the first place,

permanently wipe Harry and Ron’s memories at the 
time, Harry’s sympathy was limited.

quill from his pocket.",['Lockhart']

corridors?",['Ron']

precocious two-year-old.",['Lockhart']

seems to be regaining the power of speech very well,

yet...",['Mr.']

the new arrivals.",['Mr. Weasley']

around wildly for some means of distracting the 
others so that Neville could leave the ward unnoticed 
and unquestioned, but Ron had looked up at the 
sound of the name “Longbottom” too, and before 
Harry could stop him had called, “Neville\”

harder to bring off unnoticed when you were wearing

himself once again under the tyranny of Dolores

through another dozen decrees in their absence.",['Umbridge']

there was no Quidditch to look forward to now that he 
had been banned; there was every likelihood that 
their burden of homework would increase as the 
exams drew even nearer; Dumbledore remained as 
remote as ever; in fact, if it had not been for the D.A.,

him to let him leave Hogwarts and remain in 
Grimmauld Place.

kitchen?","['Ron', 'Ginny']"

you.”

think what he could have done that would make 
Snape pursue him to Grimmauld Place.",['Snape']

later to find Sirius and Snape both seated at the long 
kitchen table, glaring in opposite directions.",['Snape']

curtains of greasy black hair.

rear chair legs and speaking to the ceiling, “I think I’d

the familiar sneer curling his mouth, “but Black — ”

more quietly waspish, “but by all means stay, Black, I 
know you like to feel ... involved.”

Order.”

triumph as he turned to Harry.

are doing, least of all Dolores Umbridge.",['Umbridge']

aggressively.",['Dumbledore']

delegate less enjoyable tasks,” said Snape silkily.",['Snape']

had balled his fist in the pocket of his cloak over what 
Harry was sure was the handle of his wand.",['Snape']

simply bounces off him,” Snape said sleekly.

around the table toward Snape, pulling out his wand 
as he went; Snape whipped out his own.",['Snape']

squaring up to each other, Sirius looking livid, Snape 
calculating, his eyes darting from Sirius’s wand tip to 
his face.

barely a foot from Snape ’s, “I don’t care if Dumbledore

Snape.","['Snape', 'Dumbledore']"

gazing at the scene in front of them, which was also

looking toward the door with their wands pointing 
into each other’s faces and Harry immobile between

force them apart.

off his face, “what’s going on here?”

tell Sirius was trying to make it so, yet when his

food, his face fell back into a moody, brooding 
expression.",['Mr. Weasley']

Mundungus and Mad-Eye, who had dropped in to 
offer Mr. Weasley their congratulations; he wanted to 
talk to Sirius, to tell him that he should not listen to a 
word Snape said, that Snape was goading him 
deliberately and that the rest of them did not think 
Sirius was a coward for doing as Dumbledore told 
him and remaining in Grimmauld Place, but he had 
no opportunity to do so, and wondered occasionally, 
eyeing the ugly look on Sirius’s face, whether he 
would have dared to even if he had the chance.

kitchen when Harry, Ron, and Hermione arrived there 
next morning.","['Lupin', 'Ron']"

had a bad feeling about this parting; he did not know 
when they would next see each other and felt that it 
was incumbent upon him to say something to Sirius

worried that Snape’s accusation of cowardice had 
stung Sirius so badly he might even now be planning 
some foolhardy trip beyond Grimmauld Place.",['Snape']

time.",['Snape']

back.",['Ron']

around Grimmauld Square, weaving on and off the 
pavement, then, with another tremendous BANG, 
they were all flung backward; Ron’s chair toppled 
right over and Pigwidgeon, who had been on his lap, 
burst out of his cage and flew twittering wildly up to 
the front of the bus where he fluttered down upon 
Hermione’s shoulder instead.",['Ron']

up from the floor.",['Ron']

himself up from the floor for the sixth time, “I never 
want to ride on here again.”

last-minute good-byes with Tonks, “Harry, I know you

protect yourself, so work hard, all right?”

"“Yeah, all right,” said Harry heavily, looking up into 
Lupin’s prematurely lined face.",['Lupin']
"His morning Potions lesson did nothing to 
dispel his trepidation, as Snape was as unpleasant as 
ever, and Harry’s mood was further lowered by the 
fact that members of the D.A. were continually 
approaching him in the corridors between classes, 
asking hopefully whether there would be a meeting 
that night.

off toward the marble staircase.

feeling that the day was not going to be a complete 
loss after all, he headed off to the library to pick up 
Ron and Hermione before their afternoon lessons, 
walking in a rather bouncy way himself.

"By six o’clock that evening, however, even the glow of 
having successfully asked out Cho Chang was 
insufficient to lighten the ominous feelings that 
intensified with every step Harry took toward Snape’s 
office.

ingredients that Snape had once accused Harry — not 
without reason — of robbing.",['Snape']

cold eyes and wondering whether he would answer.

said contemptuously, “Surely even you could have 
worked that out by now, Potter?",['Snape']

eyes glittering.",['Snape']

pleasure of insulting Harry, before continuing, “Only

walls and grounds of Hogwarts are guarded by many 
ancient spells and charms to ensure the bodily and 
mental safety of those who dwell within them,” said

dangerous voice.","['Mr. Weasley', 'Snape']"

quietly.

moment,” snarled Snape.",['Snape']

merely raised the wand to his temple and placed its 
tip into the greasy roots of his hair.",['Snape']

more Snape raised the wand to his temple and 
deposited the silvery substance into the stone basin,

he picked up the Pensieve carefully, removed it to a 
shelf out of their way and returned to face Harry with 
his wand held at the ready.

end of Charms, said “Shh\” and hurried away; and 
Professor Trelawney broke into hysterical sobs during 
Divination and announced to the startled class, and a 
very disapproving Umbridge, that Harry was not going 
to suffer an early death after all, but would live to a 
ripe old age, become Minister of Magic, and have 
twelve children.

"If anything more was needed to complete Harry’s 
happiness, it was Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s 
reactions.",['Malfoy']
"They looked around at Harry as he 
browsed the shelves for the book he needed on Partial 
Vanishment, and Goyle cracked his knuckles 
threateningly and Malfoy whispered something 
undoubtedly malevolent to Crabbe.",['Malfoy']
"Harry was a hero in the Gryffindor common room that 
night; daringly, Fred and George had put an 
Enlargement Charm on the front cover of The 
Quibbler and hung it on the wall, so that Harry’s giant 
head gazed down upon the proceedings, occasionally 
saying things like “The Ministry are morons” and “Eat 
dung, Umbridge” in a booming voice.",['Umbridge']
"Harry had to admit that the poster 
was not quite as funny after an hour or two, 
especially when the talking spell had started to wear 
off, so that it merely shouted disconnected words like 
“Dung” and “Umbridge” at more and more frequent 
intervals in a progressively higher voice.",['Umbridge']
"Undoubtedly that is why 
he fought so hard against Malfoy’s Imperius Curse...” 

“Stand up, Rookwood,” whispered Harry. 

",['Malfoy']
"For a few seconds 
he did not know where he was; he was convinced that 
he was about to see the white, skull-like face looming 
at him out of the dark again, then Ron’s voice spoke 
very near to him.

"Ron wrenched the hangings apart, and Harry stared 
up at him in the moonlight, as he lay flat on his back, 
his scar searing with pain.",['Ron']
"Ron looked as though he 
had just been getting ready for bed; one arm was out 
of his robes. 

",['Ron']
"“Has someone been attacked again?” asked Ron, 
pulling Harry roughly to his feet.",['Ron']

scared.",['Ron']
"I think he said Malfoy’s dad put it 
on him...”

"Ron 
said.",['Ron']

to Harry’s on the pretense of helping himself to water 
from the jug on his bedside table, “that you were You- 
Know-Who?”

Ron took an unnecessarily large gulp of water.,['Ron']

and rolled over onto his side with his back to Ron and 
after a while he heard Ron’s mattress creak as he lay 
back down too.",['Ron']

Hermione exactly what had happened.",['Ron']
"Of course, it would have been easy for

Lucius Malfoy to put the curse on him.",['Malfoy']
"“Sorry?” said Ron, looking bewildered. 

",['Ron']
"Lucius 
Malfoy got him too.",['Malfoy']
"So what if he was standing guard by the 
door, invisible, and Malfoy heard him move, or 
guessed he was there, or just did the Imperius Curse 
on the off chance that a guard was there?",['Malfoy']
"So when 
Sturgis next had an opportunity — probably when it 
was his turn on guard duty again — he tried to get 
into the department to steal the weapon for Voldemort 
— Ron, be quiet — but he got caught and sent to 
Azkaban...” 

",['Ron']
"The week did not improve as it progressed: Harry 
received two more D’s in Potions, was still on 
tenterhooks that Hagrid might get the sack, and 
could not stop himself from dwelling on the dream in 
which he had seen Voldemort, though he did not 
bring it up with Ron and Hermione again because he 
did not want another telling-off from Hermione.","['Ron', 'Hagrid']"

was to be found, yet again, kneeling on the floor of 
Snape’s office, trying to clear his head.",['Snape']

separate memories from the rush of images and 
sound that Snape kept calling forth.",['Snape']

what Snape had said about eye contact being crucial

your head, Potter?” said Snape.

Harry looked back at Snape, hating him — “I would 
have thought that after two months’ worth of lessons 
you might have made some progress.",['Snape']

slightly, “perhaps you actually enjoy having these 
visions and dreams, Potter.",['Snape']

“because you are neither special nor important, and it 
is not up to you to find out what the Dark Lord is 
saying to his Death Eaters.”

eyes fixed upon Harry’s face, muttering under his 
breath...",['Snape']

Snape staggered; his wand flew upward, away from 
Harry — and suddenly Harry’s mind was teeming 
with memories that were not his — a hook-nosed man 
was shouting at a cowering woman, while a small 
dark-haired boy cried in a corner. . .",['Snape']
"Harry felt as though he had been pushed hard in the 
chest; he took several staggering steps backward, hit 
some of the shelves covering Snape’s walls and heard 
something crack.",['Snape']

white in the face.

more.",['Snape']
"Panting slightly, Snape straightened 
the Pensieve in which he had again stored some of his 
thoughts before starting the lesson, almost as though 
checking that they were still there.",['Snape']
"He was sure he had just broken 
into Snape’s memories, that he had just seen scenes 
from Snape’s childhood, and it was unnerving to 
think that the crying little boy who had watched his 
parents shouting was actually standing in front of 
him with such loathing in his eyes...

",['Snape']
"“On the count of three, then,” said Snape, raising his 
wand once more.",['Snape']
"“One — two — ” 

Harry did not have time to gather himself together 
and attempt to clear his mind, for Snape had already 
cried “ Legilimens\”

Department of Mysteries, past the blank stone walls,

"“Explain yourself!” said Snape, who was standing over 
him, looking furious.

"For some reason, Snape seemed even angrier than he 
had done two minutes before, when Harry had seen 
into his own memories.

"“Why do you call Voldemort the Dark Lord, I’ve 
only ever heard Death Eaters call him that — ” 

Snape opened his mouth in a snarl — and a woman 
screamed from somewhere outside the room.

ceiling.

so early, nor to tell Ron and Hermione what he had 
just seen.",['Ron']
"What was making Harry feel so horrified 
and unhappy was not being shouted at or having jars 
thrown at him — it was that he knew how it felt to be 
humiliated in the middle of a circle of onlookers, knew 
exactly how Snape had felt as his father had taunted 
him, and that judging from what he had just seen, his 
father had been every bit as arrogant as Snape had 
always told him.

supposed to be charming with their wands.",['Ron']

four very thin spindly legs that hoisted the cup off the

with a wave of her wand.",['Ron']

stood drunkenly again, trembling violently at the 
knees.",['Ron']

Umbridge’s screening process,” said Ron bitterly, now

support its weight, “I’m going to be in deep trouble.","['Ron', 'Umbridge']"

Ron darkly.",['Ron']

his wand that its legs collapsed again and it lay 
twitching before him.",['Ron']

the Cup.”

down to the pitch a little later in the midst of a very 
excitable crowd, “I think Ron might do better without

picked up a crossbow that was leaning against a tree.

cobwebs, but which snagged Harry and Hermione’s 
robes, frequently entangling them so severely that

themselves.",['Hagrid']

forest now that sometimes all Harry could see of 
Hagrid in the gloom was a massive dark shape ahead

as Hagrid that he thought, with a jolt of dread, was 
sure to be the lair of some enormous animal.",['Hagrid']

had been ripped up at the roots all around the 
mound, so that it stood on a bare patch of ground

wanted to come!”

breathing.",['Hagrid']

sounding desperate.",['Hagrid']

close to tears himself, “an’ — an’ taught him a few 
manners — I’d be able",['Hagrid']

frantic hushing noises with his hands as the 
enormous creature before them grunted loudly and 
shifted in its sleep.",['Hagrid']

earnestly.",['Hagrid']

small!” said Hagrid.

you — ”

voice, backing away with the long bough raised, ready 
to poke Grawp again.",['Hagrid']

sixteen feet tall.",['Hagrid']

out a hand the size of a beach umbrella, seized a 
bird’s nest from the upper branches of a towering 
pine and turned it upside down with a roar of 
apparent displeasure that there was no bird in it — 
eggs fell like grenades toward the ground and Hagrid 
threw his arms over his head to protect himself.

"“Anyway, Grawpy,” shouted Hagrid, looking up 
apprehensively in case of further falling eggs, “I’ve 
brought some friends ter meet yeh.",['Hagrid']

to say whether he was listening to Hagrid or whether 
he even recognized the sounds Hagrid was making as 
speech.",['Hagrid']

knee a sharp poke.

and whimpering.",['Hagrid']

crossbow.",['Hagrid']

to be attempting to Stun him.

bouncing off him.",['Hagrid']

off the suffocating mass —

about?”

from the baby bird, “you will be pleased to hear that 
none of your fellow students are going to suffer 
lasting damage from the night’s events.”

seemed to him that Dumbledore was reminding him 
of the amount of damage he had caused by his 
actions tonight, and although Dumbledore was for

in the terrible emptiness, filling him with the desire to 
hurt Dumbledore for his calmness and his empty 
words.

",['Dumbledore']
"“You do care,” said Dumbledore.",['Dumbledore']

calm old face, shake him, hurt him, make him feel

cold and almost as calm as Dumbledore ’s.

upon Dumbledore, upon the silver of his eyebrows

might mean.",['Dumbledore']

concerned that Voldemort might realize that this 
connection between you exists.",['Dumbledore']

speaking, of course, of the night when you witnessed 
the attack on Mr. Weasley.” 

",['Mr. Weasley']
"“Yeah, Snape told me,” Harry muttered. 

",['Snape']
"“Professor Snape, Harry,” Dumbledore corrected him 
quietly.","['Snape', 'Dumbledore']"
"He could see now that Dumbledore 
looked sad and tired. 

",['Dumbledore']
"“You see,” continued Dumbledore heavily.",['Dumbledore']
"Harry remembered the feeling that a dormant snake 
had risen in him, ready to strike, on those occasions 
when he and Dumbledore made eye contact. 

",['Dumbledore']
"In an attempt to arm you against 
Voldemort’s assaults on your mind, I arranged 
Occlumency lessons with Professor Snape.” 

",['Snape']
"Harry watched the sunlight, which was 
sliding slowly across the polished surface of 
Dumbledore’s desk, illuminate a silver ink pot and a 
handsome scarlet quill.",['Dumbledore']
"Harry could tell that the 
portraits all around them were awake and listening 
raptly to Dumbledore’s explanation.",['Dumbledore']

“that you had been dreaming about the door to the 
Department of Mysteries for months.","['Snape', 'Dumbledore']"

didn’t bother, I could’ve stopped myself having those 
dreams, Hermione kept telling me to do it, if I had 
he’d never have been able to show me where to go, 
and — Sirius wouldn’t — Sirius wouldn’t — ” 

Something was erupting inside Harry’s head: a need 
to justify himself, to explain — 

“I tried to check if he’d really taken Sirius, I went to 
Umbridge’s office, I spoke to Kreacher in the fire, and 
he said Sirius wasn’t there, he said he’d gone!”

Christmas,” said Dumbledore, “when Sirius, 
apparently, shouted at him to ‘get out.’",['Dumbledore']

Narcissa, sister of Bellatrix and wife of Lucius 
Malfoy.” 

",['Malfoy']
"“Kreacher told me last night,” said Dumbledore.",['Dumbledore']
"“You 
see, when you gave Professor Snape that cryptic 
warning, he realized that you had had a vision of 
Sirius trapped in the bowels of the Department of 
Mysteries.",['Snape']
"I should explain that members of the Order of 
the Phoenix have more reliable methods of 
communicating than the fire in Dolores Umbridge’s 
office.",['Umbridge']
"Professor Snape found that Sirius was alive 
and safe in Grimmauld Place. 

",['Snape']
"“When, however, you did not return from your trip 
into the forest with Dolores Umbridge, Professor 
Snape grew worried that you still believed Sirius to be 
a captive of Lord Voldemort’s.","['Umbridge', 'Snape']"
"Dumbledore heaved a great sigh and then said, 
“Alastor Moody, Nymphadora Tonks, Kingsley 
Shacklebolt, and Remus Lupin were at headquarters 
when he made contact.","['Lupin', 'Dumbledore']"
"Professor Snape requested that Sirius remain 
behind, as he needed somebody to remain at 
headquarters to tell me what had happened, for I was 
due there at any moment.",['Snape']
"In the meantime he, 
Professor Snape, intended to search the forest for 
you. 

",['Snape']
"“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore.",['Dumbledore']
"“Like the fact that the person Sirius cared most about 
in the world was you,” said Dumbledore quietly.",['Dumbledore']
"“He did not wish to tell me,” said Dumbledore.",['Dumbledore']
"“And,” whispered Harry, his hands curled in cold fists 
on his knees, “and Hermione kept telling us to be nice 
to him — ” 

“She was quite right, Harry,” said Dumbledore.",['Dumbledore']
"But the rage that had 
subsided so briefly had flared in him again; he would 
not let Dumbledore criticize Sirius.",['Dumbledore']
"“Kreacher ’s a lying 

— foul — he deserved — ” 

“Kreacher is what he has been made by wizards, 
Harry,” said Dumbledore.",['Dumbledore']
"He was on his feet again, furious, ready to fly at 
Dumbledore, who had plainly not understood Sirius 
at all, how brave he was, how much he had suffered 



“What about Snape?”","['Snape', 'Dumbledore']"
"he just sneered at me as usual — ” 

“Harry, you know that Professor Snape had no choice 
but to pretend not to take you seriously in front of 
Dolores Umbridge,” said Dumbledore steadily, “but as 
I have explained, he informed the Order as soon as 
possible about what you had said.","['Dumbledore', 'Snape', 'Umbridge']"
"It was he too who gave Professor 
Umbridge fake Veritaserum when she was attempting 
to force you to tell of Sirius’s whereabouts...” 

",['Umbridge']
"Harry disregarded this; he felt a savage pleasure in 
blaming Snape, it seemed to be easing his own sense 
of dreadful guilt, and he wanted to hear Dumbledore 
agree with him.

"“Snape — Snape g-goaded Sirius about staying in the 
house — he made out Sirius was a coward — ”

already said that it was a mistake for me not to teach 
you myself, though I was sure, at the time, that 
nothing could have been more dangerous than to 
open your mind even further to Voldemort while in 
my presence — ” 

“Snape made it worse, my scar always hurt worse 
after lessons with him — ” Harry remembered Ron’s 
thoughts on the subject and plunged on.","['Ron', 'Snape']"

know he wasn’t trying to soften me up for Voldemort,

Professor Snape could overcome his feelings about 
your father — I was wrong.”

hate my dad, but it’s not okay for Sirius to hate 
Kreacher?”

grounds outside the window, then looked back at

slightly, “that she might need reminding of the pact 
she had sealed by taking you.",['Dumbledore']

though he had not paused in his story, “you arrived 
at Hogwarts, neither as happy nor as well nourished
