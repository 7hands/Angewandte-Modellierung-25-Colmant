admirable and brave and all the rest of it, I don’t 
personally fancy the mortality rate — ”

on rats.",['Slughorn']

his wand, so that it glowed like a torch, and smiled 
down at Harry.

Sirius; it had been painful enough to hear Uncle

chill emptiness that he had come to associate with

bowed them out of the shop it was with an air of

pondering the meaning of Malfoy’s behavior in 
Knockturn Alley.",['Malfoy']
"What disturbed him most was the 
satisfied look on Malfoy’s face as he had left the shop. 
",['Malfoy']
"Nothing that made Malfoy look that happy could be 
good news.",['Malfoy']
"To his slight annoyance, however, neither 
Ron nor Hermione seemed quite as curious about 
Malfoy’s activities as he was; or at least, they seemed 
to get bored of discussing it after a few days. 

","['Ron', 'Malfoy']"
"“But haven’t we agreed there could 
be a lot of explanations?” 

“Maybe he’s broken his Hand of Glory,” said Ron 
vaguely, as he attempted to straighten his

"“Remember that 
shriveled-up arm Malfoy had?” 

",['Malfoy']
"“That sounded to me like Borgin’s got another one of 
the broken objects, and Malfoy wants both.” 

",['Malfoy']
"“You reckon?” said Ron, now trying to scrape some 
dirt off his broom handle. 

",['Ron']
"When neither Ron nor 
Hermione answered, he said, “Malfoy’s father’s in 
Azkaban.","['Ron', 'Malfoy']"
"Don’t you think Malfoy’d like revenge?” 

Ron looked up, blinking.

"“Malfoy, revenge?",['Malfoy']

nervously.

Who would let Malfoy join?”

repressive sort of voice.",['Malfoy']

the dust at Fleur’s feet.","['Ron', 'Ginny']"

King’s Cross Station.",['Hagrid']

Auror, Harry motioned to Ron and Hermione to follow 
him up the platform, looking for an empty 
compartment.

and then patrol the corridors for a bit.”

making up his mind on the spur of the moment.

"“Of course,” said Mr. Weasley, who looked slightly 
surprised, but followed Harry out of earshot of the 
others nevertheless. 

",['Mr. Weasley']
"Harry had thought it through carefully and come to 
the conclusion that, if he was to tell anyone, Mr. 
Weasley was the right person; firstly, because he 
worked at the Ministry and was therefore in the best 
position to make further investigations, and secondly, 
because he thought that there was not too much risk 
of Mr. Weasley exploding with anger.

exasperation and amusement.","['Mr. Weasley', 'Malfoy']"

resigned.",['Mr. Weasley']

mile when Madam Malkin tried to touch his left arm.",['Malfoy']

"“Mr. Weasley, 
I’m sorry, but isn’t it worth investigating?",['Mr. Weasley']
"If Malfoy 
wants something fixing, and he needs to threaten 
Borgin to get it done, it’s probably something Dark or 
dangerous, isn’t it?” 

",['Malfoy']
"“I doubt it, to be honest, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley 
slowly.",['Mr. Weasley']
"“You see, when Lucius Malfoy was arrested, 
we raided his house.",['Malfoy']

that Mr. Weasley was humoring him.

Weasley cried, “Harry, quickly!”

fixed with Dumbledore, so we’ll see you quite soon,”

slammed the door shut behind him and the train

began to move.",['Dumbledore']

Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were lost to view, then turned 
to see where the others had got to.",['Mr.']

carriage, but Ginny was a little way along the 
corridor, chatting to some friends.","['Ron', 'Ginny']"
"He tapped Ginny on the shoulder.

"“Fancy trying to find a compartment?” 

“I can’t, Harry, I said I’d meet Dean,” said Ginny 
brightly.",['Ginny']
"He felt a strange twinge of 
annoyance as she walked away, her long red hair 
dancing behind her; he had become so used to her 
presence over the summer that he had almost 
forgotten that Ginny did not hang around with him, 
Ron, and Hermione while at school.","['Ron', 'Ginny']"
"“No point now we’ve got rid of Umbridge, is there?” 
said Harry, sitting down.",['Umbridge']

a scarless Harry who would have been kissed good- 
bye by his own mother, not Ron’s?

when the sun was visible almost directly overhead,

last.

Harry and rubbing his stomach.",['Ron']

Malfoy to pass up the chance to demonstrate his 
power as prefect, which he had happily abused all the 
previous year.

rude hand gesture.",['Ron']

on his mind than bullying younger students?

perplexedly at his own invitation. 

",['Slughorn']

wave, “let’s go under the Invisibility Cloak, then we 
might get a good look at Malfoy on the way, see what 
he’s up to.”

"When they reached compartment C, they saw at once 
that they were not Slughorn’s only invitees, although 
judging by the enthusiasm of Slughorn’s welcome, 
Harry was the most warmly anticipated.

sight of him so that his great velvet-covered belly 
seemed to fill all the remaining space in the 
compartment.",['Slughorn']

Slughorn, they sat down opposite each other in the 
only two empty seats, which were nearest the door.

recognized a Slytherin from their year, a tall black boy 
with high cheekbones and long, slanting eyes; there 
were also two seventh-year boys Harry did not know

looking as though she was not entirely sure how she 
had got there, Ginny.

cozily.",['Slughorn']

pleasure of teaching his Uncle Damocles,” Slughorn 
told Harry and Neville, now passing around a basket 
of rolls.",['Slughorn']

of pheasant; in his haste to answer Slughorn he 
swallowed too fast, turned purple, and began to 
choke.

at Belby, whose airway seemed to clear at once.

looking questioningly at Belby.",['Slughorn']

another bite of pheasant until he was sure that

smile and turned to McLaggen instead.

know you see a lot of your Uncle Tiberius, because he 
has a rather splendid picture of the two of you 
hunting nogtails in, I think, Norfolk?”

to have been invited because they were connected to 
somebody well-known or influential — everyone 
except Ginny.",['Ginny']

the impression that Slughorn was reserving judgment 
on Neville, yet to see whether he had any of his 
parents’ flair.

seat with the air of a compere introducing his star 
act.",['Slughorn']

voice burst out from behind Slughorn.

around at Ginny, who was glaring at Zabini around

fond — you were there, then?",['Dumbledore']

smile.

little disappointed.",['Slughorn']

me (Gwenog Jones, I mean, of course, Captain of the 
Holyhead Harpies) — ”

but Harry had the distinct impression that Slughorn 
had not finished with him, and that he had not been 
convinced by Neville and Ginny.

"The afternoon wore on with more anecdotes about 
illustrious wizards Slughorn had taught, all of whom 
had been delighted to join what he called the “Slug 
Club” at Hogwarts.",['Slughorn']

emerged from yet another long misty stretch into a 
red sunset, and Slughorn looked around, blinking in 
the twilight.

along the train.

at the Ministry and in the end he annoyed me so 
much I hexed him — when Slughorn came in I 
thought I was going to get detention, but he just 
thought it was a really good hex and invited me to 
lunch!",['Slughorn']

minute’s time, Zabini was going to reenter the 
Slytherin sixth-year compartment and Malfoy would 
be sitting there, thinking himself unheard by anybody 
except fellow Slytherins. ...",['Malfoy']

Goyle and Zabini were snarling at each other, drawing 
all eyes onto them, for Harry was quite sure his feet 
and ankles had been revealed as the cloak had 
flapped around them; indeed, for one horrible 
moment he thought he saw Malfoy’s eyes follow his

trainer as it whipped upward out of sight.",['Malfoy']
"But then 
Goyle slammed the door shut and flung Zabini off 
him; Zabini collapsed into his own seat looking 
ruffled, Vincent Crabbe returned to his comic, and

curled uncomfortably under the cloak to ensure that

Pansy stroke the sleek blond hair off Malfoy’s 
forehead, smirking as she did so, as though anyone 
would have loved to have been in her place.",['Malfoy']

aside.

out of the corner of her eyes for his reaction.",['Malfoy']

lap and allowed her to resume the stroking of his 
hair.

humorless laugh.

something that you need to be qualified for,” said 
Malfoy quietly.

effect he had created as he pointed out of the 
blackened window.",['Malfoy']

it hit Harry hard on the side of the head.",['Malfoy']

involuntary gasp of pain, and Malfoy looked up at the 
luggage rack, frowning.

much like the idea of being discovered hiding under 
his Invisibility Cloak by a group of unfriendly 
Slytherins.",['Malfoy']
"To his 
relief, Malfoy seemed to decide that he had imagined 
the noise; he pulled on his robes like the others, 
locked his trunk, and as the train slowed to a jerky 
crawl, fastened a thick new traveling cloak round his 
neck.

"Harry could see the corridors filling up again and 
hoped that Hermione and Ron would take his things 
out onto the platform for him; he was stuck where he 
was until the compartment had quite emptied.",['Ron']

him with her hand held out as though hoping he

from their first encounter, but Snape had placed 
himself forever and irrevocably beyond the possibility

think over the summer, and had concluded that 
Snape ’s snide remarks to Sirius about remaining 
safely hidden while the rest of the Order of the 
Phoenix were off fighting Voldemort had probably 
been a powerful factor in Sirius rushing off to the 
Ministry the night that he had died.","['Snape', 'Dumbledore']"

this notion, because it enabled him to blame Snape,

fast that he was passing the Hufflepuff table before

"Harry was sure that 
Slughorn had not forgotten the potion at all, but had 
waited to be asked for dramatic effect.",['Slughorn']

turned, smiling, to look at Hermione, who had let out 
an audible gasp, “that you know what Felix Felicis 
does, Miss Granger?”

sleek blond head, because he was at last giving 
Slughorn his full and undivided attention.

recklessness, and dangerous overconfidence,” said 
Slughorn.",['Slughorn']
"“Twice in my life,” said Slughorn.",['Slughorn']

earth, “is what I shall be offering as a prize in this 
lesson.”

a minuscule glass bottle with a cork in it out of his 
pocket and showing it to them all.",['Slughorn']

win my fabulous prize?",['Slughorn']

through his copy of Advanced Potion-Making.",['Malfoy']

not have been clearer that Malfoy really wanted that 
lucky day.",['Malfoy']

Slytherin table.

wasn’t unexpected, dragon pox at his age. ...”

picked up in Slughorn’s dungeon.",['Slughorn']

once.",['Ginny']

continued to follow the Half-Blood Prince’s 
instructions wherever they deviated from Libatius

that he had rarely taught anyone so talented.",['Slughorn']

do your detention next Saturday instead.”

on his mind than S nape’s detention, and now looked 
around surreptitiously for some indication of what 
Dumbledore was planning to do with him this 
evening.",['Dumbledore']
"The circular office looked just as it always 
did; the delicate silver instruments stood on spindle- 
legged tables, puffing smoke and whirring; portraits of 
previous headmasters and headmistresses dozed in 
their frames, and Dumbledore’s magnificent phoenix, 
Fawkes, stood on his perch behind the door, watching 
Harry with bright interest.",['Dumbledore']

Dumbledore, as casually as if Harry had asked him 
about the next day’s weather, “and I certainly hope 
that it will help you to survive.”

desk, past Harry, who turned eagerly in his seat to 
watch Dumbledore bending over the cabinet beside

holding a familiar shallow stone basin etched with 
odd markings around its rim.",['Dumbledore']

Dumbledore, pulling from his pocket a crystal bottle 
containing a swirling silvery- white substance.

Enforcement,” said Dumbledore.",['Dumbledore']

stopper of the crystal bottle: His injured hand seemed 
stiff and painful.

cork flew out.

bowl.

adjusted, Dumbledore landed beside him.

stride, and Harry hurried to keep up.",['Dumbledore']

Little Hangleton must be their final destination and 
wondered, as he had done on the night they had 
found Slughorn, why they had to approach it from 
such a distance.",['Slughorn']

dirt track bordered by higher and wilder hedgerows 
than those they had left behind.",['Dumbledore']

track soon opened up at the copse, and Dumbledore 
and Harry came to a halt behind Ogden, who had 
stopped and drawn his wand.

Dumbledore quietly.

coat.",['Mr.']

point, we have reason to believe that your son,

night.”

as Merope, who had already picked up the pot, 
flushed blotchily scarlet, lost her grip on the pot 
again, drew her wand shakily from her pocket, 
pointed it at the pot, and muttered a hasty, inaudible 
spell that caused the pot to shoot across the floor 
away from her, hit the opposite wall, and crack in 
two.

reason for my visit — ”

his ground.

"Know how much 
I’ve been offered for this, with the Peverell coat of 
arms engraved on the stone?”

sailed within an inch of his nose, “and it’s quite 
beside the point, Mr. Gaunt.",['Mr.']
"“Mr. Gaunt, your daughter!” said Ogden in alarm, but 
Gaunt had already released Merope; she staggered 
away from him, back to her corner, massaging her 
neck and gulping for air. 

",['Mr.']
"“Mr. Gaunt,” said Ogden doggedly, “I am afraid that 
neither your ancestors nor mine have anything to do 
with the matter in hand.",['Mr.']

clean for him, and his memory to boot — ”

ought to follow and Harry obeyed, Merope ’s screams 
echoing in his ears.

darkness, until they landed squarely on their feet,

at once, as Dumbledore lit extra lamps with a flick of 
his wand.",['Dumbledore']

Merope was a witch.",['Dumbledore']

husband, could not bear to continue enslaving him by 
magical means.",['Dumbledore']

Dumbledore ’s office seemed to glow more brightly 
than before.

hours of practicing nonverbal spells was that Harry,

resisted the temptation to laugh, remembering that

"Had Dumbledore forgotten the lessons he was 
supposed to be giving Harry?",['Dumbledore']

that the lessons were leading to something to do with 
the prophecy; Harry had felt bolstered, comforted, 
and now he felt slightly abandoned.

textbooks; that sort of behavior, as Ron rightly said, 
was indecent in anybody except Hermione, who was 
simply weird that way.",['Ron']
"The more Harry pored 
over the book, the more he realized how much was in 
there, not only the handy hints and shortcuts on 
potions that were earning him such a glowing 
reputation with Slughorn, but also the imaginative 
little jinxes and hexes scribbled in the margins, which 
Harry was sure, judging by the crossings-out and 
revisions, that the Prince had invented himself. 

",['Slughorn']
"Harry rather doubted he would be able 
to bring off this particular spell; he was still having 
difficulty with nonverbal spells, something Snape had 
been quick to comment on in every D.A.D.A. class.",['Snape']
"On 
the other hand, the Prince had proved a much more 
effective teacher than Snape so far. 

",['Snape']
"There was a flash of light and the room was full of 
voices: Everyone had woken up as Ron had let out a 
yell.",['Ron']
"Harry sent Advanced Potion-Making flying in 
panic; Ron was dangling upside down in midair as 
though an invisible hook had hoisted him up by the 
ankle.

heap onto his mattress.

"By the time they had got dressed, padding themselves 
out with several of Mrs. Weasley’s hand-knitted 
sweaters and carrying cloaks, scarves, and gloves, 
Ron’s shock had subsided and he had decided that 
Harry’s new spell was highly amusing; so amusing, in 
fact, that he lost no time in regaling Hermione with 
the story as they sat down for breakfast.

that he would tell Riddle there would be plenty of time 
for practical demonstrations at Hogwarts, that they 
were currently in a building full of Muggles and must 
therefore be cautious.",['Dumbledore']
"To his great surprise, however, 
Dumbledore drew his wand from an inside pocket of 
his suit jacket, pointed it at the shabby wardrobe in 
the corner, and gave the wand a casual flick.

rounded on Dumbledore, the flames vanished, leaving

have?” asked Dumbledore.

look.",['Dumbledore']

",['Dumbledore']
"“You will return them to their owners with your 
apologies,” said Dumbledore calmly, putting his wand 
back into his jacket.",['Dumbledore']

staring coldly and appraisingly at Dumbledore.",['Dumbledore']
"“At Hogwarts,” Dumbledore went on, “we teach you 
not only to use magic, but to control it.",['Dumbledore']
"When he 
had finished, he turned to Dumbledore and said 
baldly, “I haven’t got any money.” 

",['Dumbledore']
"“That is easily remedied,” said Dumbledore, drawing a 
leather money-pouch from his pocket.",['Dumbledore']
"You might have to buy some of 
your spellbooks and so on secondhand, but — ” 

“Where do you buy spellbooks?” interrupted Riddle, 
who had taken the heavy money bag without 
thanking Dumbledore, and was now examining a fat 
gold Galleon.

surprised.",['Dumbledore']

Riddle exactly how to get to the Leaky Cauldron from

gentle.

out his hand again.",['Dumbledore']

broken; Dumbledore was at the door.

Hermione about his lesson with Dumbledore over 
breakfast for fear of being overheard, but he filled 
them in as they walked across the vegetable patch 
toward the greenhouses.","['Ron', 'Dumbledore']"

back with a pair of secateurs; Harry succeeded in 
trapping a couple of vines and knotting them 
together; a hole opened in the middle of all the 
tentaclelike branches; Hermione plunged her arm 
bravely into this hole, which closed like a trap around 
her elbow; Harry and Ron tugged and wrenched at 
the vines, forcing the hole to open again, and 
Hermione snatched her arm free, clutching in her 
fingers a pod just like Neville’s.",['Ron']

my garden when I’ve got my own place,” said Ron,

sweat from his face.

interrupted conversation as though a lump of wood 
had not just attacked them, “Slughorn’s going to have 
a Christmas party, Harry, and there’s no way you’ll be

asked me to check your free evenings, so he could be 
sure to have it on a night you can come.”

"Meanwhile, Ron, who was attempting 
to burst the pod in the bowl by putting both hands on 
it, standing up, and squashing it as hard as he could, 
said angrily, “And this is another party just for 
Slughorn’s favorites, is it?” 

","['Slughorn', 'Ron']"

greenhouse glass, rebounding onto the back of 
Professor Sprout’s head and knocking off her old, 
patched hat.",['Ron']

got back, Hermione was saying, “Look, / didn’t make 
up the name ‘Slug Club’ — ”

Malfoy.","['Ron', 'Malfoy']"
"Why don’t you try hooking up with McLaggen,

for some reason had turned a bright, boiling scarlet, 
“and I was going to ask you to come, but if you think 
it’s that stupid",['Slughorn']

“You were going to ask me?” asked Ron, in a 
completely different voice. 

",['Ron']
"“No, I wouldn’t,” said Ron, in a very quiet voice. 

",['Ron']
"The 
crash, however, appeared to have awoken Ron and 
Hermione to Harry’s presence.",['Ron']
"Hermione looked 
flustered and immediately started fussing about for 
her copy of Flesh-Eating Trees of the World to find out 
the correct way to juice Snargaluff pods; Ron, on the 
other hand, looked sheepish but also rather pleased 
with himself.

Harry passed her the pod in the bowl; he and Ron 
both snapped their goggles back over their eyes and 
dived, once more, for the stump. 

",['Ron']
"He and Cho were now too 
embarrassed to look at each other, let alone talk to 
each other; what if Ron and Hermione started going 
out together, then split up?",['Ron']
"“Gotcha!” yelled Ron, pulling a second pod from the 
stump just as Hermione managed to burst the first 
one open, so that the bowl was full of tubers wriggling 
like pale green worms.

"The rest of the lesson passed without further mention 
of Slughorn’s party.",['Slughorn']

friends more closely over the next few days, Ron and 
Hermione did not seem any different except that they 
were a little politer to each other than usual.",['Ron']

supposed he would just have to wait to see what 
happened under the influence of butterbeer in 
Slughorn’s dimly lit room on the night of the party.",['Slughorn']

Dean fly that evening; he worked well with Ginny and 
Demelza.",['Ginny']
The only problem was Ron,['Ron']

Harry had known all along that Ron was an 
inconsistent player who suffered from nerves and a 
lack of confidence, and unfortunately, the looming 
prospect of the opening game of the season seemed to 
have brought out all his old insecurities.",['Ron']
"After letting 
in half a dozen goals, most of them scored by Ginny, 
his technique became wilder and wilder, until he 
finally punched an oncoming Demelza Robins in the 
mouth.

ground, dripping blood everywhere.",['Ron']

look at the state of her!” 

",['Ron']
"“And Ginny, don’t call Ron a prat,

thought someone should — ”

hollow voice when the door had swung shut behind 
Ginny.

Keeper I tried out, Ron.",['Ron']

way back to the castle, and by the time they reached 
the second floor, Ron was looking marginally more 
cheerful.",['Ron']

take their usual shortcut up to Gryffindor Tower,

Ginny, who were locked in a close embrace and 
kissing fiercely as though glued together.

"Wrestling with this sudden 
madness, he heard Ron’s voice as though from a great 
distance away.

exactly?”

turning maroon.

swiftly between them.

roared, trying to get a clear shot at Ginny around

Harry out of the way.

against the wall.

sounded close to tears now.",['Ginny']

Viktor Krum, it’s only you who acts like it’s something 
disgusting, Ron, and that’s because you’ve got about 
as much experience as a twelve-year-old!”

"Harry quickly let go 
of Ron; the look on his face was murderous.",['Ron']
"Ron barked at a small 
girl who jumped in fright and dropped a bottle of 
toadspawn.

Ron’s sister, he told himself.",['Ron']

her kissing Dean because she’s Ron’s sister. ...

“betrayal of trust” . . .",['Ron']

abruptly, as they approached the Fat Lady.",['Ron']

gave a guilty start and wrenched his imagination 
away from a corridor in which no Ron intruded, in

the look on Harry’s face.

indeed, they barely spoke to each other that evening 
and got into bed in silence, each absorbed in his own 
thoughts.

canopy of his four-poster and trying to convince 
himself that his feelings for Ginny were entirely elder- 
brotherly.",['Ginny']

and sister all summer, playing Quidditch, teasing 
Ron, and having a laugh about Bill and Phlegm?",['Ron']

friendship with Ron for anything.",['Ron']

pillow into a more comfortable shape and waited for 
sleep to come, trying his utmost not to allow his 
thoughts to stray anywhere near Ginny.

"Harry awoke next morning feeling slightly dazed and 
confused by a series of dreams in which Ron had 
chased him with a Beater’s bat, but by midday he 
would have happily exchanged the dream Ron for the 
real one, who was not only cold-shouldering Ginny 
and Dean, but also treating a hurt and bewildered 
Hermione with an icy, sneering indifference.","['Ron', 'Ginny']"

was more, Ron seemed to have become, overnight, as 
touchy and ready to lash out as the average Blast- 
Ended Skrewt.",['Ron']
"Harry spent the day attempting to 
keep the peace between Ron and Hermione with no 
success; finally, Hermione departed for bed in high 
dudgeon, and Ron stalked off to the boys’ dormitory

for looking at him.

"To Harry’s dismay, Ron’s new aggression did not wear 
off over the next few days.",['Ron']
"“You shut up and leave her alone!” shouted Peakes, 
who was about two-thirds Ron’s height, though 
admittedly carrying a heavy bat. 

",['Ron']
"“ENOUGH!” bellowed Harry, who had seen Ginny 
glowering in Ron’s direction and, remembering her 
reputation as an accomplished caster of the Bat- 
Bogey Hex, soared over to intervene before things got 
out of hand.","['Ron', 'Ginny']"
"Ron ...” he waited until the rest of the team 
were out of earshot before saying it, “you’re my best 
mate, but carry on treating the rest of them like this 
and I’m going to kick you off the team.” 

",['Ron']
"He really thought for a moment that Ron might hit 
him, but then something much worse happened: Ron 
seemed to sag on his broom; all the fight went out of 
him and he said, “I resign.",['Ron']

Harry fiercely, seizing Ron by the front of his robes.

shook his head wearily.",['Ron']

boosting Ron’s confidence all through dinner, but Ron 
was too busy being grumpy and surly with Hermione

evening, but his assertion that the whole team would 
be devastated if Ron left was somewhat undermined 
by the fact that the rest of the team was sitting in a 
huddle in a distant corner, clearly muttering about 
Ron and casting him nasty looks.",['Ron']
"Finally Harry tried 
getting angry again in the hope of provoking Ron into 
a defiant, and hopefully goal-saving, attitude, but this 
strategy did not appear to work any better than 
encouragement; Ron went to bed as dejected and 
hopeless as ever.

was it his first as Captain, but he was determined to 
beat Draco Malfoy at Quidditch even if he could not 
yet prove his suspicions about him.",['Malfoy']

as he had done in the last few practices, their 
chances of winning were very slim.",['Ron']

toast.

tired of Ron’s recent unpleasant behavior that she

on her way up the table.

crowd shrieked and laughed, the Gryffindor team

wand at Ron, her expression wild: The little flock of

A SLUGGISH MEMORY 

Late in the afternoon, a few days after New Year, 
Harry, Ron, and Ginny lined up beside the kitchen 
fire to return to Hogwarts.","['Ron', 'Ginny']"
"Only Mrs. 
Weasley was there to say good-bye, as Mr. Weasley, 
Fred, George, Bill, and Fleur were all at work.",['Mr. Weasley']
"Admittedly, it took very little to set her off lately; she 
had been crying on and off ever since Percy had 
stormed from the house on Christmas Day with his 
glasses splattered with mashed parsnip (for which 
Fred, George, and Ginny all claimed credit). 

",['Ginny']
"“Don’t cry, Mum,” said Ginny, patting her on the back 
as Mrs. Weasley sobbed into her shoulder.",['Ginny']

mother to plant a very wet kiss on his cheek, “or

about Percy.",['Ron']
"He had one last fleeting view of the 
Weasleys’ kitchen and Mrs. Weasley’s tearful face 
before the flames engulfed him; spinning very fast, he 
caught blurred glimpses of other Wizarding rooms, 
which were whipped out of sight before he could get a 
proper look; then he was slowing down, finally 
stopping squarely in the fireplace in Professor 
McGonagall’s office.",['McGonagall']

arrived, all three of them trooped out of McGonagall’s 
office and off toward Gryffindor Tower.","['McGonagall', 'Ginny']"

front of his cabin.

the Fat Lady, who was looking rather paler than 
usual and winced at his loud voice.

“Harry! Ginny!” 

",['Ginny']
"“I got back a couple of hours ago, I’ve just been down 
to visit Hagrid and Buck — I mean Witherwings,” she 
said breathlessly.",['Hagrid']

Scrim — ” 

“I’ve got something for you, Harry,” said Hermione, 
neither looking at Ron nor giving any sign that she 
had heard him.",['Ron']
"Anyway 



She rummaged in her pocket for a moment, then 
pulled out a scroll of parchment with Dumbledore’s 
writing on it.

that his next lesson with Dumbledore was scheduled 
for the following night.",['Dumbledore']

nowhere and flung herself into Ron’s arms.",['Ron']
"Coming, 
Ginny?” 

",['Ginny']

sound very enthusiastic.",['Ginny']
"Leaving Ron and Lavender 
locked in a kind of vertical wrestling match, Harry led 
Hermione over to the spare table.

"She looked too fierce to argue with at that moment, so 
Harry dropped the subject of Ron and recounted all 
that he had overheard between Malfoy and Snape.

moment and then said, “Don’t you think — ?”

trick Malfoy into telling him what he’s doing?” 

“Well, yes,” said Hermione.

grudgingly.","['Lupin', 'Ron']"

planning something, you can’t deny that.”

would that be?”

quill to sign after Hermione when Lavender crept up 
behind him, slipped her hands over his eyes, and

Hermione stalking off; he caught up with her, having 
no wish to stay behind with Ron and Lavender, but to 
his surprise, Ron caught up with them only a little 
way beyond the portrait hole, his ears bright red and 
his expression disgruntled.",['Ron']
"“So — Apparition,” said Ron, his tone making it 
perfectly plain that Harry was not to mention what 
had just happened.",['Ron']

it yourself, I didn’t enjoy it much when Dumbledore 
took me along for the ride.”

test first time,” said Ron, looking anxious.",['Ron']

arms out from his body as though he was a gorilla —

to his face anyway ...”

"Ron was not the only one to be excited at the prospect 
of Apparition.",['Ron']

wand a little too enthusiastically, so that instead of 
producing the fountain of pure water that was the 
object of today’s Charms lesson, he let out a hoselike

Professor Flitwick flat on his face.

stick.”","['Ron', 'Flitwick']"

what had caused such a distinctive injury, but did 
not ask; Dumbledore had said that he would know

in the Daily Prophet”

Dumbledore spoke, however, his voice was quite 
steady.

impassive face.",['Dumbledore']

brainpower, I understood everything you told me,”

had indeed ordered Snape to find out what Malfoy 
was doing, in which case he had already heard 
everything Harry had just told him from Snape?","['Snape', 'Dumbledore', 'Malfoy']"
"“I have been tolerant enough to answer that question 
already,” said Dumbledore, but he did not sound very 
tolerant anymore.",['Dumbledore']

"How would it be if 
he refused to permit the change of subject, if he 
insisted upon arguing the case against Malfoy?",['Malfoy']
"As 
though he had read Harry’s mind, Dumbledore shook 
his head. 

",['Dumbledore']
"“Well, you are quite right, because it is not,” said 
Dumbledore briskly.",['Dumbledore']
"“So,” said Dumbledore, in a ringing voice, “we meet 
this evening to continue the tale of Tom Riddle, whom 
we left last lesson poised on the threshold of his years 
at Hogwarts.",['Dumbledore']
"He was placed in Slytherin House almost the 
moment that the Sorting Hat touched his head,” 
continued Dumbledore, waving his blackened hand 
toward the shelf over his head where the Sorting Hat 
sat, ancient and unmoving.",['Dumbledore']

who had opened his mouth to speak.",['Dumbledore']
"Here, again, was 
Dumbledore ’s tendency to trust people in spite of 
overwhelming evidence that they did not deserve it!

‘Dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the 
other teachers did.’ ”

you will stand ...”

arm and they were soaring back into the present 
again.",['Dumbledore']

seemed to dazzle Harry’s eyes after that impenetrable 
darkness.

that point onward,” said Dumbledore, gesturing Harry 
back into his seat.",['Dumbledore']
"The exception 
sits before me,” Dumbledore added, with a nod to 
Harry’s scar.",['Dumbledore']
"“That’s right,” said Dumbledore.",['Dumbledore']
"“Never,” said Dumbledore.",['Dumbledore']
"Yes, but it took a great deal of skilled Legilimency to 
coax it out of him,” said Dumbledore, “and why 
should anybody delve further into Morfin’s mind 
when he had already confessed to the crime? 

",['Dumbledore']
"“So if you’re underage and you do magic inside an 
adult witch or wizard’s house, the Ministry won’t 
know?” 

“They will certainly be unable to tell who performed 
the magic,” said Dumbledore, smiling slightly at the 
look of great indignation on Harry’s face.",['Dumbledore']
"“Look what 
happened here, look what happened to Morfin!”

Dumbledore took from an inside pocket another 
crystal phial and Harry fell silent at once, 
remembering that Dumbledore had said it was the 
most important one he had collected.",['Dumbledore']

had finally emptied the phial.",['Dumbledore']
It was a much younger Horace Slughorn.,['Slughorn']

so used to him bald that he found the sight of 
Slughorn with thick, shiny, straw-colored hair quite 
disconcerting; it looked as though he had had his 
head thatched, though there was already a shiny 
Galleon-sized bald patch on his crown.",['Slughorn']
"He was not quite as rotund as the Slughorn 
Harry knew, though the golden buttons on his richly 
embroidered waistcoat were taking a fair amount of 
strain.",['Slughorn']

him and saw that they were standing in Slughorn ’s 
office.","['Slughorn', 'Dumbledore']"

all in their mid-teens.",['Slughorn']
"“Tom, Tom, if I knew I couldn’t tell you,” said 
Slughorn, wagging a reproving, sugar-covered finger 
at Riddle, though ruining the effect slightly by 
winking.",['Slughorn']
"The whole room was suddenly filled with a 
thick white fog, so that Harry could see nothing but 
the face of Dumbledore, who was standing beside 
him.",['Dumbledore']
"Then Slughorn ’s voice rang out through the 
mist, unnaturally loudly, “ You’ll go wrong, boy, mark 
my words.”

"Bewildered, Harry looked around as a small golden

o’clock.

beside him.","['Slughorn', 'Dumbledore']"

important memory of all, but he could not see what

been tampered with.”

undoubtedly be our most crucial piece of information 
of all.”

truth from Professor Slughorn by force, and might do 
much more harm than good; I do not wish him to

able to look after them all.",['Hagrid']

swapping tales of the illegal trade in dragon eggs) he 
pointed his wand under the table at the emptying

plainer you come from decent Wizarding stock,

around.

fiddling with the ribbon on top of his box of 
crystalized pineapple, “well, it can’t hurt to give you 
an overview, of course.",['Slughorn']

full of that same wild happiness it had worn when he 
had first found out that he was a wizard, the sort of 
happiness that did not enhance his handsome 
features, but made them, somehow, less human. ...

thoughts, and then said, “Four years ago, I received 
what I considered certain proof that Voldemort had 
split his soul.”

explained, to keep part of the self hidden and safe,

you know what they are, sir?”

to bet — perhaps not my other hand — but a couple 
of fingers, that they became Horcruxes three and 
four.",['Dumbledore']

behind him, where a ruby-encrusted sword reposed

that can think and move for itself is obviously a very 
risky business.",['Dumbledore']

error, and acted on Professor Trelawney’s words!",['Trelawney']

"“This is merely the antechamber, the entrance hall,” 
said Dumbledore after a moment or two.",['Dumbledore']
"...” 

Dumbledore approached the wall of the cave and 
caressed it with his blackened fingertips, murmuring 
words in a strange tongue that Harry did not 
understand.",['Dumbledore']
"Twice Dumbledore walked right around 
the cave, touching as much of the rough rock as he 
could, occasionally pausing, running his fingers 
backward and forward over a particular spot, until 
finally he stopped, his hand pressed flat against the 
wall. 

",['Dumbledore']
Harry did not ask how Dumbledore knew.,['Dumbledore']
"Dumbledore stepped back from the cave wall and 
pointed his wand at the rock.",['Dumbledore']
"Dumbledore looked around. 

",['Dumbledore']
"“Thank you,” said Harry gratefully, but Dumbledore 
had already turned his attention back to the solid 
cave wall.",['Dumbledore']
"Harry stayed 
quite still; he did not want to break Dumbledore’s 
concentration.",['Dumbledore']
"Then, after two solid minutes, 
Dumbledore said quietly, “Oh, surely not.",['Dumbledore']
"“What is it, Professor?” 

“I rather think,” said Dumbledore, putting his 
uninjured hand inside his robes and drawing out a 
short silver knife of the kind Harry used to chop 
potion ingredients, “that we are required to make 
payment to pass.” 

",['Dumbledore']

“Yes,” said Dumbledore.",['Dumbledore']
"“Blood, if I am not much 
mistaken.” 

“Blood?” 

“I said it was crude,” said Dumbledore, who sounded 
disdainful, even disappointed, as though Voldemort 
had fallen short of the standards Dumbledore 
expected.",['Dumbledore']
"“Sometimes, however, it is unavoidable,” said 
Dumbledore, shaking back the sleeve of his robes and 
exposing the forearm of his injured hand. 

",['Dumbledore']
"“Professor!” protested Harry, hurrying forward as 
Dumbledore raised his knife.",['Dumbledore']
But Dumbledore merely smiled.,['Dumbledore']
"“You are very kind, Harry,” said Dumbledore, now 
passing the tip of his wand over the deep cut he had 
made in his own arm, so that it healed instantly, just 
as Snape had healed Malfoy’s wounds.","['Snape', 'Dumbledore', 'Malfoy']"
"“After me, I think,” said Dumbledore, and he walked 
through the archway with Harry on his heels, lighting 
his own wand hastily as he went. 

",['Dumbledore']
"“Let us walk,” said Dumbledore quietly.",['Dumbledore']
"“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore.",['Dumbledore']
"“Certainly we could,” said Dumbledore, stopping so 
suddenly that Harry almost walked into him.",['Dumbledore']
"Harry 
leapt backward in shock and hit the wall; his heart 
was still thundering as he turned to Dumbledore. 

",['Dumbledore']
"“What the things are, you mean,” said Dumbledore.",['Dumbledore']
"And Dumbledore pointed toward the misty green light 
in the center of the lake. 

",['Dumbledore']
"“Aha,” said Dumbledore, and he stopped again; this 
time, Harry really did walk into him; for a moment he 
toppled on the edge of the dark water, and 
Dumbledore’s uninjured hand closed tightly around 
his upper arm, pulling him back.",['Dumbledore']
"Page | 632 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry had no idea what Dumbledore meant; this 
patch of dark bank was exactly like every other bit as 
far as he could tell, but Dumbledore seemed to have 
detected something special about it.",['Dumbledore']
"“Oho,” said Dumbledore happily, seconds later.",['Dumbledore']
"Dumbledore moved closer to the water; 
Harry watched nervously as the tips of Dumbledore ’s 
buckled shoes found the utmost edge of the rock rim. 
",['Dumbledore']
"Keeping his hand clenched in midair, Dumbledore 
raised his wand with the other and tapped his fist 
with the point. 

",['Dumbledore']
"Immediately a thick coppery green chain appeared 
out of thin air, extending from the depths of the water 
into Dumbledore ’s clenched hand.",['Dumbledore']
"Dumbledore 
tapped the chain, which began to slide through his 
fist like a snake, coiling itself on the ground with a 
clinking sound that echoed noisily off the rocky walls, 
pulling something from the depths of the black water. 
",['Dumbledore']
"Harry gasped as the ghostly prow of a tiny boat broke 
the surface, glowing as green as the chain, and 
floated, with barely a ripple, toward the place on the 
bank where Harry and Dumbledore stood. 

",['Dumbledore']
"“Magic always leaves traces,” said Dumbledore, as the 
boat hit the bank with a gentle bump, “sometimes 
very distinctive traces.",['Dumbledore']
"“Voldemort would have been reasonably confident 
that none but a very great wizard would have been 
able to find the boat,” said Dumbledore.",['Dumbledore']
"Dumbledore chuckled. 

",['Dumbledore']
"These words did nothing to raise Harry’s morale; 
perhaps Dumbledore knew it, for he added, 
“Voldemort’s mistake, Harry, Voldemort’s mistake ... 
",['Dumbledore']
"Dumbledore stood aside and Harry climbed carefully 
into the boat.",['Dumbledore']
"Dumbledore stepped in too, coiling the 
chain onto the floor.",['Dumbledore']
"“Yes, I am sure you did,” said Dumbledore calmly. 

",['Dumbledore']
"“So that thing that jumped out of the water — ?” 

But Harry had his answer before Dumbledore could 
reply; the wandlight had slid over a fresh patch of 
water and showed him, this time, a dead man lying 
faceup inches beneath the surface, his open eyes 
misted as though with cobwebs, his hair and his 
robes swirling around him like smoke. 

",['Dumbledore']
"“Yes,” said Dumbledore placidly, “but we do not need 
to worry about them at the moment.” 

",['Dumbledore']
"Harry repeated, tearing his gaze 
from the water to look at Dumbledore. 

",['Dumbledore']
"“Not while they are merely drifting peacefully below 
us,” said Dumbledore.",['Dumbledore']
"“But one of them jumped,” he said, trying to make his 
voice as level and calm as Dumbledore ’s. “When I 
tried to Summon the Horcrux, a body leapt out of the 
lake.” 

",['Dumbledore']
"“Yes,” said Dumbledore.",['Dumbledore']
"Fire, 
Harry,” Dumbledore added with a smile, in response 
to Harry’s bewildered expression. 

",['Dumbledore']
"It seemed hours and hours 
ago that he had met Professor Trelawney, that he had 
given Ron and Hermione Felix Felicis. ...","['Ron', 'Trelawney']"
"and 
he hadn’t seen Ginny at all. ... 

",['Ginny']
"“Nearly there,” said Dumbledore cheerfully.

"“Careful not to touch the water,” said Dumbledore 
again as Harry climbed out of the boat.

The island was no larger than Dumbledore ’s office, an 
expanse of flat dark stone on which stood nothing but 
the source of that greenish light, which looked much 
brighter when viewed close to.",['Dumbledore']
"Dumbledore approached the basin and Harry 
followed.",['Dumbledore']
"“I am not sure,” said Dumbledore.",['Dumbledore']
"“Something more 
worrisome than blood and bodies, however.” 

Dumbledore pushed back the sleeve of his robe over 
his blackened hand, and stretched out the tips of his 
burned fingers toward the surface of the potion. 

",['Dumbledore']
"“I cannot touch,” said Dumbledore, smiling faintly. 
",['Dumbledore']
"“Out of the way, please, Harry,” said Dumbledore.",['Dumbledore']
"Harry remained 
silent while Dumbledore worked, but after a while 
Dumbledore withdrew his wand, and Harry felt it was 
safe to talk again. 

",['Dumbledore']
"Dumbledore peered more closely into the 
basin.",['Dumbledore']
"Almost absentmindedly, Dumbledore raised his wand 
again, twirled it once in midair, and then caught the 
crystal goblet that he had conjured out of nowhere. 

",['Dumbledore']
"“But what if — what if it kills you?” 

“Oh, I doubt that it would work like that,” said 
Dumbledore easily.",['Dumbledore']
"Was this more of 
Dumbledore ’s insane determination to see good in 
everyone? 



",['Dumbledore']
"Page | 639 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Sir,” said Harry, trying to keep his voice reasonable, 
“sir, this is Voldemort we’re — ” 

“I’m sorry, Harry; I should have said, he would not 
want to immediately kill the person who reached this 
island,” Dumbledore corrected himself.",['Dumbledore']
"Harry made to speak again, but this time Dumbledore 
raised his hand for silence, frowning slightly at the 
emerald liquid, evidently thinking hard. 

",['Dumbledore']
"Was 
this why he had been invited along — so that he 
could force-feed Dumbledore a potion that might 
cause him unendurable pain? 

",['Dumbledore']
"“You remember,” said Dumbledore, “the condition on 
which I brought you with me?” 

",['Dumbledore']
"“Yes,” said Harry, “but — ” 

“Well, then,” said Dumbledore, shaking back his 
sleeves once more and raising the empty goblet, “you 
have my orders.” 

",['Dumbledore']
"“Because I am much older, much cleverer, and much 
less valuable,” said Dumbledore.",['Dumbledore']
"“I — all right, but — ” 

Before Harry could make any further protest, 
Dumbledore lowered the crystal goblet into the 
potion.",['Dumbledore']
"For a split second, Harry hoped that he would 
not be able to touch the potion with the goblet, but 
the crystal sank into the surface as nothing else had; 
when the glass was full to the brim, Dumbledore lifted 
it to his mouth. 



",['Dumbledore']
"he said anxiously, as Dumbledore 
lowered the empty glass.",['Dumbledore']
"Dumbledore shook his head, his eyes closed.",['Dumbledore']
"Dumbledore 
plunged the glass blindly back into the basin, refilled 
it, and drank once more. 

",['Dumbledore']
"In silence, Dumbledore drank three gobletsful of the 
potion.",['Dumbledore']
"“Professor Dumbledore?” said Harry, his voice 
strained.",['Dumbledore']
"“Can you hear me?” 

Dumbledore did not answer.",['Dumbledore']
"Dumbledore panted and then spoke in a voice Harry 
did not recognize, for he had never heard Dumbledore 
frightened like this. 

",['Dumbledore']
"""... don’t like ... want to stop ...” moaned Dumbledore. 

",['Dumbledore']
"Here ...” 

Hating himself, repulsed by what he was doing, Harry 
forced the goblet back toward Dumbledore ’s mouth 
and tipped it, so that Dumbledore drank the 
remainder of the potion inside. 

",['Dumbledore']
"“It’s all right, I’m here — ” 

“Make it stop, make it stop,” moaned Dumbledore. 

",['Dumbledore']
"He tipped 
the contents of the goblet into Dumbledore ’s open 
mouth. 

",['Dumbledore']
"Dumbledore screamed; the noise echoed all around 
the vast chamber, across the dead black water. 

",['Dumbledore']
"And obediently, Dumbledore drank, as though it was 
an antidote Harry offered him, but upon draining the 
goblet, he sank to his knees, shaking uncontrollably. 

",['Dumbledore']
"“This will make it stop, Professor,” Harry said, his 
voice cracking as he tipped the seventh glass of 
potion into Dumbledore’s mouth. 

",['Dumbledore']
"Dumbledore began to cower as though invisible 
torturers surrounded him; his flailing hand almost 
knocked the refilled goblet from Harry’s trembling 
hands as he moaned, “Don’t hurt them, don’t hurt 
them, please, please, it’s my fault, hurt me instead ...” 

“Here, drink this, drink this, you’ll be all right,” said 
Harry desperately, and once again Dumbledore 
obeyed him, opening his mouth even as he kept his 
eyes tight shut and shook from head to foot. 

",['Dumbledore']
"Dumbledore drank like a child dying of thirst, but 
when he had finished, he yelled again as though his 
insides were on fire.",['Dumbledore']
"He supported Dumbledore’s shoulders and again, 
Dumbledore drained the glass; then Harry was on his 
feet once more, refilling the goblet as Dumbledore 
began to scream in more anguish than ever, “I want 
to die!",['Dumbledore']
"...” 

Dumbledore drank, and no sooner had he finished 
than he yelled, “KILL ME!” 

",['Dumbledore']
"Dumbledore gulped at the goblet, drained every last 
drop, and then, with a great, rattling gasp, rolled over 
onto his face. 

",['Dumbledore']
"“No!” shouted Harry, who had stood to refill the goblet 
again; instead he dropped the cup into the basin, 
flung himself down beside Dumbledore, and heaved 
him over onto his back; Dumbledore’s glasses were 
askew, his mouth agape, his eyes closed.",['Dumbledore']
"“No,” said 
Harry, shaking Dumbledore, “no, you’re not dead, you 
said it wasn’t poison, wake up, wake up — 
Rennervatel” he cried, his wand pointing at 
Dumbledore’s chest; there was a flash of red light but 
nothing happened.",['Dumbledore']
"“Renneruate — sir — please — ” 

Dumbledore’s eyelids flickered; Harry’s heart leapt. 

",['Dumbledore']
"Page | 645 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




“Water,” croaked Dumbledore. 

",['Dumbledore']
"The goblet filled with clear water; Harry dropped to 
his knees beside Dumbledore, raised his head, and 
brought the glass to his lips — but it was empty. 
",['Dumbledore']
"Dumbledore groaned and began to pant. 

",['Dumbledore']
"Once more, for 
a second, clear water gleamed within it, but as he 
approached Dumbledore ’s mouth, the water vanished 
again. 

",['Dumbledore']
"“Sir, I’m trying, I’m trying!” said Harry desperately, 
but he did not think that Dumbledore could hear 
him; he had rolled onto his side and was drawing 
great, rattling breaths that sounded agonizing. 
",['Dumbledore']
"And now 
Dumbledore ’s breathing was fading.",['Dumbledore']
"Harry yelled, and lunging forward, he 
tipped the water clumsily over Dumbledore’s face. 

",['Dumbledore']
"Dumbledore was on his feet again, pale as any of the 
surrounding Inferi, but taller than any too, the fire 
dancing in his eyes; his wand was raised like a torch 
and from its tip emanated the flames, like a vast 
lasso, encircling them all with warmth. 

",['Dumbledore']
"Dumbledore scooped the locket from the bottom of 
the stone basin and stowed it inside his robes. 
",['Dumbledore']
"Distracted by the flames, the Inferi seemed unaware 
that their quarry was leaving as Dumbledore led 
Harry back to the boat, the ring of fire moving with 
them, around them, the bewildered Inferi 
accompanying them to the water’s edge, where they 
slipped gratefully back into their dark waters. 



",['Dumbledore']
"Page | 648 Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling 




Harry, who was shaking all over, thought for a 
moment that Dumbledore might not be able to climb 
into the boat; he staggered a little as he attempted it; 
all his efforts seemed to be going into maintaining the 
ring of protective flame around them.",['Dumbledore']
"“Sir,” panted Harry, “sir, I forgot — about fire — they 
were coming at me and I panicked — ” 

“Quite understandable,” murmured Dumbledore. 
",['Dumbledore']
"They reached the bank with a little bump and Harry 
leapt out, then turned quickly to help Dumbledore. 
",['Dumbledore']
"The moment that Dumbledore reached the bank he 
let his wand hand fall; the ring of fire vanished, but 
the Inferi did not emerge again from the water.",['Dumbledore']
"Dumbledore gave a great sigh and leaned against 
the cavern wall. 

",['Dumbledore']
"“Don’t worry, sir,” said Harry at once, anxious about 
Dumbledore ’s extreme pallor and by his air of 
exhaustion.",['Dumbledore']
"And pulling Dumbledore ’s uninjured arm around his 
shoulders, Harry guided his headmaster back around 
the lake, bearing most of his weight. 



",['Dumbledore']

“The protection was ... after all ... well-designed,” said 
Dumbledore faintly.",['Dumbledore']
"“Don’t talk now,” said Harry, fearing how slurred 
Dumbledore’s voice had become, how much his feet 
dragged.",['Dumbledore']
"They crossed the outer cave, and 
Harry helped Dumbledore back into the icy seawater 
that filled the crevice in the cliff. 

",['Dumbledore']
"“It’s going to be all right, sir,” Harry said over and 
over again, more worried by Dumbledore’s silence 
than he had been by his weakened voice.",['Dumbledore']
"“I am not worried, Harry,” said Dumbledore, his voice 
a little stronger despite the freezing water.",['Dumbledore']
"Once back under the starry sky, Harry heaved 
Dumbledore onto the top of the nearest boulder and 
then to his feet.",['Dumbledore']
"Sodden and shivering, Dumbledore’s 
weight still upon him, Harry concentrated harder 
than he had ever done upon his destination: 
",['Dumbledore']
"Closing his eyes, gripping Dumbledore’s 
arm as tightly as he could, he stepped forward into 
that feeling of horrible compression. 

",['Dumbledore']
"He and 
Dumbledore were shivering and dripping in the 
middle of the dark High Street in Hogsmeade.",['Dumbledore']
Dumbledore staggered against him.,['Dumbledore']
"For a moment, 
Harry thought that his inexpert Apparition had 
thrown Dumbledore off balance; then he saw his face, 
paler and damper than ever in the distant light of a 
streetlamp. 

",['Dumbledore']
"“Sir, are you all right?” 

“I’ve been better,” said Dumbledore weakly, though 
the corners of his mouth twitched.",['Dumbledore']
"And to Harry’s horror, Dumbledore sank onto the 
ground. 

",['Dumbledore']
"“Sir — it’s okay, sir, you’re going to be all right, don’t 
worry — ” 

He looked around desperately for help, but there was 
nobody to be seen and all he could think was that he 
must somehow get Dumbledore quickly to the 
hospital wing.

you for a moment so I can — ” 

Before Harry could make a move, however, he heard 
running footsteps.",['Snape']
"She came to a halt, panting, and stared down, wide- 
eyed, at Dumbledore. 

",['Dumbledore']
"“If you help me support him,” said Harry, not 
listening to her, “I think we can get him inside — ” 

“What has happened?” asked Dumbledore. 

",['Dumbledore']
"“When did it appear?” asked Dumbledore, and his 
hand clenched painfully upon Harry’s shoulder as he 
struggled to his feet. 

",['Dumbledore']
"“Must have been minutes ago, it wasn’t there when I 
put the cat out, but when I got upstairs — ” 

“We need to return to the castle at once,” said 
Dumbledore.",['Dumbledore']

said Dumbledore, as he mounted the broom nearest 
him.",['Dumbledore']

over himself before mounting his broom: Madam 
Rosmerta was already tottering back toward her pub

and rose up into the air.",['Dumbledore']
"As they sped toward the 
castle, Harry glanced sideways at Dumbledore, ready 
to grab him should he fall, but the sight of the Dark 
Mark seemed to have acted upon Dumbledore like a 
stimulant: He was bent low over his broom, his eyes 
fixed upon the Mark, his long silver hair and beard 
flying behind him on the night air.",['Dumbledore']

and Ginny’s luck run out by now?","['Ron', 'Ginny']"

they had walked earlier, Harry heard, over the 
whistling of the night air in his ears, Dumbledore 
muttering in some strange language again.",['Dumbledore']

thought he understood why as he felt his broom 
shudder when they flew over the boundary wall into 
the grounds: Dumbledore was undoing the 
enchantments he himself had set around the castle

him seconds later and looked around.

looking up at the green skull with its serpent’s tongue

Dumbledore clutching at his chest with his blackened 
hand.

clearly.",['Dumbledore']

who gestured him to retreat.",['Dumbledore']

wand flying in an arc over the edge of the ramparts

perform the spell had cost him the chance of

a fraction —

Malfoy was showing less resolution than ever.,['Malfoy']
"He 
looked terrified as he stared into Dumbledore ’s face,

barely aim.

with his hands outstretched, his teeth bared.

"Harry’s heart was hammering so hard it 
seemed impossible that nobody could hear him 
standing there, imprisoned by Dumbledore ’s spell — 
if he could only move, he could aim a curse from 
under the cloak — 

“Draco, do it or stand aside so one of us — ” screeched 
the woman, but at that precise moment, the door to 
the ramparts burst open once more and there stood 
Snape, his wand clutched in his hand as his black 
eyes swept the scene, from Dumbledore slumped 
against the wall, to the four Death Eaters, including 
the enraged werewolf, and Malfoy.

"“We’ve got a problem, Snape,” said the lumpy 
Amycus, whose eyes and wand were fixed alike upon 
Dumbledore, “the boy doesn’t seem able — ”

softly.

"For the first time, 

Dumbledore was pleading.

Malfoy roughly out of the way.","['Snape', 'Malfoy']"

was revulsion and hatred etched in the harsh lines of 
his face. 

","['Snape', 'Dumbledore']"
"“Severus ... please ...” 

Snape raised his wand and pointed it directly at 
Dumbledore. 

","['Snape', 'Dumbledore']"
"“Avada KedavraV’ 

A jet of green light shot from the end of Snape’s wand 
and hit Dumbledore squarely in the chest.","['Snape', 'Dumbledore']"
"Harry’s 
scream of horror never left him; silent and unmoving, 
he was forced to watch as Dumbledore was blasted 
into the air.",['Dumbledore']
"“Out of here, quickly,” said Snape. 

",['Snape']
"He seized Malfoy by the scruff of the neck and forced 
him through the door ahead of the rest; Greyback and 
the squat brother and sister followed, the latter both 
panting excitedly.",['Malfoy']
"He had to get to 
Dumbledore and he had to catch Snape. ...","['Snape', 'Dumbledore']"
Dumbledore could not have died.,['Dumbledore']
"He leapt the last ten steps of the spiral staircase and 
stopped where he landed, his wand raised: The dimly 
lit corridor was full of dust; half the ceiling seemed to 
have fallen in; and a battle was raging before him, but 
even as he attempted to make out who was fighting 
whom, he heard the hated voice shout, “It’s over, time 
to go\” and saw Snape disappearing around the corner 
at the far end of the corridor; he and Malfoy seemed 
to have forced their way through the fight unscathed. 
","['Snape', 'Malfoy']"
"Harry now saw red 
hair flying like flames in front of him: Ginny was 
locked in combat with the lumpy Death Eater, 
Amycus, who was throwing hex after hex at her while 
",['Ginny']
"His jinx hit Amycus in the chest: He gave a piglike 
squeal of pain, was lifted off his feet and slammed 
into the opposite wall, slid down it, and fell out of 
sight behind Ron, Professor McGonagall, and Lupin, 
each of whom was battling a separate Death Eater. 
","['Lupin', 'Ron', 'McGonagall']"
"Ginny cried, but 
there was no time to answer her.",['Ginny']
"Snape must not escape, he must catch up 
with Snape — 

“Take that\” shouted Professor McGonagall, and Harry 
glimpsed the female Death Eater, Alecto, sprinting 
away down the corridor with her arms over her head, 
her brother right behind her.","['McGonagall', 'Snape']"
"“Neville, are you — ?” 

“M’all right,” muttered Neville, who was clutching his 
stomach, “Harry ... Snape ’n’ Malfoy ... ran past ...” 



","['Snape', 'Malfoy']"
"He skidded around the corner, his trainers slippery 
with blood; Snape had an immense head start.",['Snape']
"He pelted toward a shortcut, hoping to overtake the 
brother and sister and close in on Snape and Malfoy, 
who must surely have reached the grounds by now. 
","['Snape', 'Malfoy']"
"Harry flew across the entrance hall and out into the 
dark grounds: He could just make out three figures 
racing across the lawn, heading for the gates beyond 
which they could Disapparate — by the looks of them, 
the huge blond Death Eater and, some way ahead of 
him, Snape and Malfoy ... 

","['Snape', 'Malfoy']"
"He did not know 
what it was but continued to run, not yet near 
enough to get a good aim with a curse — 

Another flash, shouts, retaliatory jets of light, and 
Harry understood: Hagrid had emerged from his 
cabin and was trying to stop the Death Eaters 
escaping, and though every breath seemed to shred 
his lungs and the stitch in his chest was like fire, 
Harry sped up as an unbidden voice in his head said: 
not Hagrid . . .",['Hagrid']
"not Hagrid too . . . 

",['Hagrid']
"he yelled as he rolled over again, 
crouching close to the dark ground, and miraculously 
his jinx hit one of them, who stumbled and fell, 
tripping up the other; Harry leapt to his feet and 
sprinted on after Snape. 

",['Snape']
"And now he saw the vast outline of Hagrid, 
illuminated by the light of the crescent moon revealed 
suddenly behind clouds; the blond Death Eater was 
aiming curse after curse at the gamekeeper; but 
Hagrid’s immense strength and the toughened skin 
he had inherited from his giantess mother seemed to 
be protecting him.",['Hagrid']
"Snape and Malfoy, however, were 
still running; they would soon be beyond the gates, 
able to Disapparate — 

Harry tore past Hagrid and his opponent, took aim at 
Snape’s back, and yelled, “Stupefy\” 

He missed; the jet of red light soared past Snape’s 
head; Snape shouted, “Run, Draco\” and turned. 
","['Snape', 'Hagrid', 'Malfoy']"
"“Cruc — ” 

But Snape parried the curse, knocking Harry 
backward off his feet before he could complete it; 
Harry rolled over and scrambled back up again as the 
huge Death Eater behind him yelled, “Incendiol” Harry 
heard an explosive bang and a dancing orange light 
spilled over all of them: Hagrid’s house was on fire. 
","['Snape', 'Hagrid']"
"Hagrid bellowed. 

",['Hagrid']
"“Cruc — ” yelled Harry for the second time, aiming for 
the figure ahead illuminated in the dancing firelight, 
but Snape blocked the spell again.",['Snape']
"he 
shouted over the rushing of the flames, Hagrid’s yells, 
and the wild yelping of the trapped Fang.",['Hagrid']
"“You haven’t 
got the nerve or the ability — ” 

“Incarc — ” Harry roared, but Snape deflected the spell 
with an almost lazy flick of his arm. 

",['Snape']
"“Fight back, you 
cowardly — ” 

“Coward, did you call me, Potter?” shouted Snape. 
",['Snape']
"“ Stupe — ” 

“Blocked again and again and again until you learn to 
keep your mouth shut and your mind closed, Potter!” 
sneered Snape, deflecting the curse once more.",['Snape']

screaming, he would surely die of this agony, Snape 
was going to torture him to death or madness —

“No!” roared Snape’s voice and the pain stopped as 
suddenly as it had started; Harry lay curled on the 
dark grass, clutching his wand and panting; 
somewhere overhead Snape was shouting, “Have you 
forgotten our orders?",['Snape']
"Pushing himself to his feet 
again, he staggered blindly toward Snape, the man he 
now hated as much as he hated Voldemort himself — 

“Sectum — !” 

",['Snape']
"Snape flicked his wand and the curse was repelled yet 
again; but Harry was mere feet away now and he 
could see Snape’s face clearly at last: He was no 
longer sneering or jeering; the blazing flames showed 
a face full of rage.",['Snape']
screamed Snape.,['Snape']
"He could hear Hagrid yelling and Fang howling 
as Snape closed in and looked down on him where he 
lay, wandless and defenseless as Dumbledore had 
been.","['Hagrid', 'Dumbledore', 'Snape']"

cabin, was suffused with hatred just as it had been 
before he had cursed Dumbledore.

Harry had dived for his wand; Snape shot a hex at it 
and it flew feet away into the darkness and out of 
sight. 

",['Snape']
"“Kill me like you killed 
him, you coward — ” 

“DONT — ” screamed Snape, and his face was 
suddenly demented, inhuman, as though he was in 
as much pain as the yelping, howling dog stuck in the 
burning house behind them — “CALL ME COWARD!”

"Buckbeak had flown at 
Snape, who staggered backward as the razor-sharp 
claws slashed at him.",['Snape']
"As Harry raised himself into a 
sitting position, his head still swimming from its last 
contact with the ground, he saw Snape running as 
hard as he could, the enormous beast flapping behind 
him and screeching as Harry had never heard him 
screech — 

Harry struggled to his feet, looking around groggily for 
his wand, hoping to give chase again, but even as his 
fingers fumbled in the grass, discarding twigs, he 
knew it would be too late, and sure enough, by the 
time he had located his wand, he turned only to see 
the hippogriff circling the gates.",['Snape']
"Snape had managed 
to Disapparate just beyond the school’s boundaries. 

",['Snape']
"“Hagrid,” muttered Harry, still dazed, looking around. 
",['Hagrid']
"Hagrid’s huge, hairy face was swimming above Harry, 
blocking out the stars.",['Hagrid']
"Hagrid put his hands under Harry’s arms and raised 
him up with such force that Harry’s feet momentarily 
left the ground before Hagrid set him upright again.

"He could see blood trickling down Hagrid’s cheek 
from a deep cut under one eye, which was swelling 
rapidly. 

",['Hagrid']
"“Knew it was summat like that,” mumbled Hagrid, 
and he raised a smoldering pink, flowery umbrella 
and said, “Aguamenti\” 

A jet of water flew out of the umbrella tip.",['Hagrid']
"Harry 
raised his wand arm, which felt like lead, and 
murmured “Aguamenti’ too: Together, he and Hagrid 
poured water on the house until the last flame was 
extinguished.

jinx. ...

toward the foot of the Astronomy Tower, where a

no hope from the moment that the full Body-Bind
