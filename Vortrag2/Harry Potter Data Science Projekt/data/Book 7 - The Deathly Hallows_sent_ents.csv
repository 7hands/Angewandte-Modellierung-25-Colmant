that remained was when he would become Minister of 
Magic.",['Dumbledore']

generations to come, as will the wisdom he displayed

the Wizengamot.",['Dumbledore']

ever matched that between Dumbledore and 
Grindelwald in 1 945.",['Dumbledore']

find something to value in anyone, however 
apparently insignificant or wretched, and I believe 
that his early losses endowed him with great 
humanity and sympathy.",['Dumbledore']
"Dumbledore was 
wearing his familiar, kindly smile, but as he peered 
over the top of his half-moon spectacles, he gave the 
impression, even in newsprint, of X-raying Harry, 
whose sadness mingled with a sense of humiliation.

"He had thought he knew Dumbledore quite well, but 
ever since reading this obituary he had been forced to 
recognize that he had barely known him at all.",['Dumbledore']

youth; it was as though he had sprung into being as 
Harry had known him, venerable and silver-haired

simply odd, like trying to imagine a stupid Hermione

past.",['Dumbledore']

ask Dumbledore what that had been like, nor about 
any of his other famous achievements.",['Dumbledore']

the fact that his future was so dangerous and so 
uncertain, that he had missed irreplaceable 
opportunities when he had failed to ask Dumbledore

",['Dumbledore']
"“Well, of course, Dumbledore is a biographer’s dream,” 
says Skeeter.",['Dumbledore']

hundred-page book was completed a mere four weeks 
after Dumbledore ’s mysterious death in June.",['Dumbledore']
"I mention the recent, widely publicized remarks of 
Elphias Doge, Special Advisor to the Wizengamot and 
longstanding friend of Albus Dumbledore’s, that 
“Skeeter’s book contains less fact than a Chocolate 
Frog card. ” 

",['Dumbledore']
"Does Skeeter really 
feel that four short weeks have been enough to gain a 
full picture of Dumbledore’s long and extraordinary 
life? 

",['Dumbledore']
"People were 
queuing to dish the dirt on Dumbledore anyway.",['Dumbledore']
"But old 
Dodgy Doge can get off his high hippogriff, because 
I’ve had access to a source most journalists would 
swap their wands for, one who has never spoken in 
public before and who was close to Dumbledore 
during the most turbulent and disturbing phase of 
his youth.” 

",['Dumbledore']

certainly suggested that there will be shocks in store 
for those who believe Dumbledore to have led a 
blameless life.",['Dumbledore']
"“But I can promise that anybody who still 
thinks Dumbledore was white as his beard is in for a

extremely murky past, not to mention that very fishy 
family, which he worked so hard to keep hushed up.” 

",['Dumbledore']
"I ask whether Skeeter is referring to Dumbledore ’s 
brother, Aberforth, whose conviction by the 
Wizengamot for misuse of magic caused a minor 
scandal fifteen years ago. 

",['Dumbledore']
"“No, no, I’m talking about much worse than a 
brother with a fondness for fiddling about with goats, 
worse even than the Muggle-maiming father — 
Dumbledore couldn’t keep either of them quiet anyway, 
they were both charged by the Wizengamot.",['Dumbledore']
"All I can say now is, it’s no wonder 
Dumbledore never talked about how his nose got 
broken. ”

the brilliance that led to Dumbledore ’s many magical 
discoveries?

sixteen, Ivor Dillonsby claims he had already 
discovered eight uses of dragon’s blood when 
Dumbledore ‘borrowed’ his papers.”

go dewy-eyed over Dumbledore’s spectacular victory

entire chapter to the whole Potter-Dumbledore 
relationship.",['Dumbledore']

Dumbledore took an unnatural interest in Potter from

Skeeter believe that Potter was there when 
Dumbledore died?

book — but eyewitnesses inside Hogwarts castle saw 
Potter running away from the scene moments after 
Dumbledore fell, jumped, or was pushed.",['Dumbledore']

meanwhile, may well be trembling at what is soon to 
emerge about their hero.

empty drawers and picking up books only to replace 
them on the same piles, barely conscious of what he 
was doing, as random phrases from Rita’s article 
echoed in his head: An entire chapter to the whole 
Potter-Dumbledore relationship . . .",['Dumbledore']

mirror danced away from him; he picked it up and 
turned it over in his fingers, thinking, thinking of 
Dumbledore and the lies with which Rita Skeeter was 
defaming him. ...

bright blue eyes of Albus Dumbledore would never 
pierce him again.

had thought he saw Dumbledore’s eye.",['Dumbledore']

year, and Kingsley and Mr. Weasley — ”

into Harry’s summer holidays, of two fully grown 
wizards.","['Mr. Weasley', 'Dumbledore']"

admit, however, that as Mr. Weasley had once

Harry pressed on remorselessly.",['Mr. Weasley']

Hagrid smashing down a wooden front door seemed

shade of bright pink; Lupin, grayer, more lined; Fleur, 
slender and beautiful, with her long silvery blonde 
hair; Kingsley, bald, black, broad-shouldered; Hagrid,

power of certain acts.

surrounding trees, the sword point trembled, and Ron 
gazed down into Riddle’s eyes.

he did so, Riddle’s eyes gleamed scarlet.

blossomed out of the locket, first chests, then waists, 
then legs, until they stood in the locket, side by side 
like trees with a common root, swaying over Ron and 
the real Harry, who had snatched his fingers away 
from the locket as it burned, suddenly, white-hot.

pointlessly at his side.",['Ron']

voices lifted in an evil duet.

anguish.",['Ron']

trace of scarlet in his eyes.

"“Ron — ?” 

",['Ron']
"The monstrous versions of himself and Hermione 
were gone: There was only Ron, standing there with 
the sword held slackly in his hand, looking down at 
the shattered remains of the locket on the flat rock. 

",['Ron']
"Ron was breathing heavily: His 
eyes were no longer red at all, but their normal blue; 
they were also wet.

"Ron had pierced the 
glass in both windows: Riddle’s eyes were gone, and 
the stained silk lining of the locket was smoking 
slightly.",['Ron']

vanished; torturing Ron had been its final act.

broken locket into his pocket, knelt down beside Ron, 
and placed a hand cautiously on his shoulder.",['Ron']

took it as a good sign that Ron did not throw it off.

fact that Ron’s face was hidden, “she cried for a week.

here again that Harry fully realized how much his 
absence had cost them.

Harry and wiped his nose noisily on his sleeve.",['Ron']

got to his feet again and walked to where Ron’s 
enormous rucksack lay yards away, discarded as Ron 
had run toward the pool to save Harry from drowning.

Ron, who clambered to his feet as Harry approached, 
eyes bloodshot but otherwise composed.

mumbled.

Simultaneously they walked forward and hugged, 
Harry gripping the still-sopping back of Ron’s jacket.

dark forest with the doe had seemed lengthy, with 
Ron by his side the journey back seemed to take a 
surprisingly short time.",['Ron']

Hermione, and it was with quickening excitement that 
he entered the tent, Ron lagging a little behind him.

"She saw Ron, who stood there holding the sword and 
dripping onto the threadbare carpet.",['Ron']
"Harry backed 
into a shadowy corner, slipped off Ron’s rucksack, 
and attempted to blend in with the canvas.

"Hermione slid out of her bunk and moved like a 
sleepwalker toward Ron, her eyes upon his pale face.

away, shielding his head as Hermione advanced.

Hermione: The force of it knocked her backward onto 
the floor.",['Ron']

She was pointing at Ron in dire accusation: It was 
like a malediction, and Harry could not blame Ron for 
retreating several steps. 

",['Ron']
"“I know,” Ron said, “Hermione, I’m sorry, I’m really — 



“Oh, you’re sorry!” 

",['Ron']
"She laughed, a high-pitched, out-of-control sound; 
Ron looked at Harry for help, but Harry merely 
grimaced his helplessness.

was glad that Ron was fighting back. 

",['Ron']
"“Rack your brains, Ron, that should only 
take a couple of seconds — ”

low blow, “he just saved my — ” 

“I don’t care!”",['Ron']

her voice for the first time, and approaching as close 
as he could with the Shield Charm between them.

hear it soon, but she had reached a level of 
indignation that rendered her temporarily speechless,

Ron glanced at Hermione, clearly hopeful she might 
soften at this small instance of humor, but her

expression remained stony above her tightly knotted 
limbs.

held up his right hand to show two missing 
fingernails; Hermione raised her eyebrows coldly —

Hermione ignored him.

remembered: It had been the first time Ron’s name

he had left; Hermione had mentioned it when talking 
about repairing Harry’s wand. 

",['Ron']
"“So I took it out,” Ron went on, looking at the 
Deluminator, “and it didn’t seem different or 
anything, but I was sure I’d heard you.",['Ron']
"Ron raised his empty hand and pointed in front of 
him, his eyes focused on something neither Harry nor 
Hermione could see.

"“I knew this was it,” said Ron.",['Ron']
"“It sort of floated toward me,” said Ron, illustrating 
the movement with his free index finger, “right to my 
chest, and then — it just went straight through.",['Ron']
"“Yeah, well, that would’ve been me,” said Ron.",['Ron']
"“Well, I stayed on that hill all day,” said Ron.",['Ron']
"Then what happened?” 

Ron explained how he had watched Harry jump into 
the pool and had waited for him to resurface; how he 
had realized that something was wrong, dived in, and 
saved Harry, then returned for the sword.",['Ron']

",['Ron']
"“Well, it — it screamed,” said Harry with half a glance 
at Ron.",['Ron']
"Deciding that it was at last safe to do so, Harry 
removed the Shield Charm with a wave of Hermione’s 
wand and turned to Ron.

"“What?” said Ron, who had been watching Hermione 
examining the locket.",['Ron']
"Ron said, but at that moment 
Hermione got to her feet, and he looked apprehensive 
again. 

",['Ron']
"Ron passed Harry the new wand. 

",['Ron']
"“Yeah,” said Ron. “Could’ve been worse.",['Ron']
"“I still haven’t ruled it out,” came Hermione’s muffled 
voice from beneath her blankets, but Harry saw Ron 
smiling slightly as he pulled his maroon pajamas out 
of his rucksack. 



",['Ron']
"Ron responded by 
maintaining an unnaturally somber demeanor in her 
presence as an outward sign of continuing remorse.

with Harry, however (collecting water and searching 
the undergrowth for mushrooms), Ron became 
shamelessly cheery.

Hermione’s sulkiness could not mar his buoyant 
spirits: The sudden upswing in their fortunes, the 
appearance of the mysterious doe, the recovery of 
Gryffindor’s sword, and above all, Ron’s return, made 
Harry so happy that it was quite difficult to maintain 
a straight face.

"Late in the afternoon he and Ron escaped Hermione’s 
baleful presence again, and under the pretense of 
scouring the bare hedges for nonexistent 
blackberries, they continued their ongoing exchange 
of news.",['Ron']
"Harry had finally managed to tell Ron the 
whole story of his and Hermione’s various 
wanderings, right up to the full story of what had 
happened at Godric’s Hollow; Ron was now filling 
Harry in on everything he had discovered about the 
wider Wizarding world during his weeks away.

"“But I haven’t got a problem calling 
him V — ”

hedge and Hermione (nose buried in a book at the 
tent entrance) to scowl over at them.",['Ron']

Ron, wrenching Harry back out of the brambles, “but 
the name’s been jinxed, Harry, that’s how they track

the end of his wand.",['Ron']

the real sword last, didn’t he?”

full in the face, desperate for the answer.

engrossed in a tuft of grass at his feet, which he 
prodded with his toe, “he must’ve known I’d run out 
on you.”

change the subject, Harry said, “Speaking of

it quite a lot. ’",['Ron']

huge news, Dumbledore being pals with Grindelwald,

bloke.",['Dumbledore']

Hermione, and something in his face seemed to 
decide Ron against pursuing the subject.

given him the previous night, which Hermione had 
since condescended to examine, and had decided was 
made of blackthorn.

taken a small wooden wireless out of his rucksack

mind that there was a chapter on him in there; he 
was not sure he felt up to hearing Rita’s version of his 
relationship with Dumbledore.",['Dumbledore']

photograph of the original letter that Dumbledore had 
written Grindelwald, with Dumbledore ’s familiar thin, 
slanting handwriting.",['Dumbledore']

that Dumbledore really had written those words, that 
they had not been Rita’s invention.

was talking about, but, looking more closely with the 
aid of his lit wand, he saw that Dumbledore had 
replaced the A of Albus with a tiny version of the 
same triangular mark inscribed upon The Tales of 
Beedle the Bard.

Hermione quelled him with a look and turned back to

"“It’s weird, being this near, but not going to visit,” 
said Ron. 

“Well, it’s not like you haven’t just seen them.",['Ron']

incredulous laugh.",['Ron']
"And Ginny, she’d have been really understanding.”

"Ron turned his back on the Burrow.

and clothes.",['Ron']
"Ron was pointing upward, toward the top 
of the hill on which they had appeared, where a most 
strange-looking house rose vertically against the sky, 
a great black cylinder with a ghostly moon hanging 
behind it in the afternoon sky.",['Ron']
"“I was talking about a chess rook,” said Ron.",['Ron']

the hill first.",['Ron']

not us.”

"What do you want?” 
he cried in a high-pitched, querulous voice, looking 
first at Hermione, then at Ron, and finally at Harry,

hand.","['Ron', 'Mr.']"
"“Mr. Lovegood — what’s that?” 

",['Mr.']
"“How d’you know it’s an Erumpent horn?” asked Ron, 
edging away from the horn as fast as he could, given 
the extreme clutter of the room. 

",['Ron']
"Mr. Lovegood, you need to get rid of it 
straightaway, don’t",['Mr.']
"“The Crumple-Horned Snorkack,” said Xenophilius 
very clearly, a mulish look upon his face, “is a shy 
and highly magical creature, and its horn — ” 

“Mr. Lovegood, I recognize the grooved markings 
around the base, that’s an Erumpent horn",['Mr.']
"Now,” he said, turning to 
Harry, “why exactly have you come here, Mr. Potter?” 



",['Mr. Potter']
"The thing is ... helping Harry Potter ... rather 
dangerous ...” 

“Aren’t you the one who keeps telling everyone it’s 
their first duty to help Harry?” said Ron.",['Ron']
"However — ” 

“That’s for everyone else to do, not you personally?” 
said Ron.

armchair and sat down, his Wellingtoned legs 
crossed, “how may I help you, Mr. Potter?” 

",['Mr. Potter']
"“Well,” said Harry, glancing at Hermione, who nodded 
encouragingly, “it’s about that symbol you were 
wearing around your neck at Bill and Fleur’s 
wedding, Mr. Lovegood.",['Mr.']

THE TALE OF THE THREE 
BROTHERS 

Harry turned to look at Ron and Hermione.",['Ron']
"Witness that knuckle-headed young man at 
your brother’s wedding,” he nodded at Ron, “who 
attacked me for sporting the symbol of a well-known 
Dark wizard!",['Ron']
"Harry said, “No,” but Ron and Hermione both said, 
“Yes.”",['Ron']
"“Well, well, Mr. Potter, the whole thing starts with 
The Tale of the Three Brothers’ ...",['Mr. Potter']
"He glanced vaguely around the room, at the piles of 
parchment and books, but Hermione said, “I’ve got a 
copy, Mr. Lovegood, I’ve got it right here.” 

",['Mr.']
"“Midnight, our mum always told us,” said Ron, who 
had stretched out, arms behind his head, to listen. 
",['Ron']
"“Sorry, I just think it’s a bit spookier if it’s midnight!” 
said Ron. 

",['Ron']
"“So he can sneak up on people,” said Ron. 

",['Ron']
"“When you say ‘master of Death’ — ” said Ron. 

“Master,” said Xenophilius, waving an airy hand. 
",['Ron']
"“Well, of course.” 

“But,” said Hermione, and Harry could hear her 
restraint starting to crack, “Mr. Lovegood, how can 
you possibly believe — ?” 

",['Mr.']
"“Perhaps you ought to try on the hat, Hermione,” said 
Ron, nodding toward the ludicrous headdress.",['Ron']
"“Mr. Lovegood,” Hermione began again.",['Mr.']
"But — ” 

“Ah, but the Third Hallow is a true Cloak of 
Invisibility, Miss Granger!",['Miss Granger']
"How many cloaks have you 
ever seen like that, Miss Granger?” 

",['Miss Granger']
"She, Harry, 
and Ron glanced at one another, and Harry knew that 
they were all thinking the same thing.",['Ron']
"“Say the 
Cloak existed ... what about the stone, Mr. Lovegood? 
",['Mr.']
"“So where do you think the Elder Wand is now?” 
asked Ron. 

",['Ron']
"Finally Hermione asked stiffly, 
“Mr. Lovegood, does the Peverell family have anything 
to do with the Deathly Hallows?” 

Xenophilius looked taken aback as something shifted 
in Harry’s memory, but he could not locate it.",['Mr.']
"“Who are the Peverells?” asked Ron. 

",['Ron']
"“Of what?” asked Ron. 

",['Ron']
"“Probably to show the Poisoning Department at St. 
Mungo’s,” said Ron under his breath. 

",['Ron']
"“I s’pose this is the man who brought us Crumple- 
Horned Snorkacks,” said Ron. 

“You don’t believe it either?”",['Ron']
"Just keep your head 
down, mind your own business, and you’ll be okay’ 
Come to think of it,” Ron added, “maybe that story’s 
why elder wands are supposed to be unlucky.” 

",['Ron']
"The one good thing 
about her exasperation with Xenophilius was that it 
seemed to have made her forget that she was annoyed 
at Ron.",['Ron']
"“It’s just a 
morality tale, it’s obvious which gift is best, which one 
you’d choose — ” 

The three of them spoke at the same time; Hermione 
said, “the Cloak,” Ron said, “the wand,” and Harry 
said, “the stone.” 

",['Ron']
"“You’re supposed to say the Cloak,” Ron told 
Hermione, “but you wouldn’t need to be invisible if 
you had the wand.",['Ron']
"“Whereas the wand would be 
bound to attract trouble — ” 

“Only if you shouted about it,” argued Ron.",['Ron']
"Hermione looked exasperated: The expression was so 
endearingly familiar that Harry and Ron grinned at 
each other. 

",['Ron']
"Ron. 

Harry laughed: The strange idea that had occurred to 
him was, after all, ridiculous.",['Ron']
"Ron asked him. 

",['Ron']
Mad-Eye ... Dumbledore ... my parents.,['Dumbledore']
"Neither Ron nor Hermione smiled. 

",['Ron']
"“I don’t think anyone except 
Mr. Lovegood could kid themselves that’s possible. 
",['Mr.']
"“What about the Cloak, though?” said Ron slowly. 
",['Ron']
"We’ve never been spotted under it — ” 

“Of course not — we’re invisible when we’re under it, 
Ron!” 

",['Ron']
"Ron, the stone ...” 

",['Ron']
"Luna had decorated her bedroom ceiling with five 
beautifully painted faces: Harry, Ron, Hermione, 
Ginny, and Neville.","['Ron', 'Ginny']"
"“Mr. Lovegood,” said Harry.",['Mr.']
"Harry, Ron, and Hermione drew their 
wands: Xenophilius froze, his hand about to enter his 
pocket.",['Ron']
"Hermione stooped down and picked up one of the 
magazines, her wand still pointing at Mr. Lovegood. 



",['Mr.']
"“Is that 
what you were doing when you went into the garden, 
Mr. Lovegood?",['Mr.']
"“No deal,” said Ron flatly.",['Ron']
"“Get out of the 
way, Mr. Lovegood.” 

“HARRY!”",['Mr.']
"Harry realized their 
mistake just in time: He launched himself sideways, 
shoving Ron and Hermione out of harm’s way as 
Xenophilius’s Stunning Spell soared across the room 
and hit the Erumpent horn. 

",['Ron']
"He heard Hermione’s scream, Ron’s yell, and a 
series of sickening metallic thuds, which told him 
that Xenophilius had been blasted off his feet and 
fallen backward down the spiral stairs. 

",['Ron']
"Ron 
was buried deepest: Harry and Hermione climbed, as 
quietly as they could, over all the wreckage to where 
he lay, trying to prise a heavy chest of drawers off his 
legs.",['Ron']
"While Xenophilius ’s banging and scraping drew 
nearer and nearer, Hermione managed to free Ron 
with the use of a Hover Charm. 

",['Ron']
"Ron, you’re going to put it on.” 

",['Ron']
"But Harry — ” 



“Please, Ron\ Harry, hold on tight to my hand, Ron, 
grab my shoulder.” 

",['Ron']
"Ron vanished beneath 
the Cloak.",['Ron']
"Ron panted, emerging 
from beneath the Invisibility Cloak and throwing it to 
Harry.",['Ron']

and the cuts to his legs.",['Ron']
"asked Ron. 

",['Ron']
"“You’re supposed to be in bed with spattergroit, Ron! 
",['Ron']
"“You’re a genius,” Ron repeated, looking awed. 

",['Ron']
"“Well, if they’re telling the truth and she’s still alive — 
” began Ron. 

“Don’t say that, don’t say it!” squealed Hermione. 

",['Ron']

Eaters, yeah,” said Ron.

“But the Deathly Hallows can’t exist, Ron!” 



",['Ron']
"“You keep saying that, but one of them can,” said 
Ron.",['Ron']
"Then, as she glanced at 
Ron, Harry realized that it was fear: He had scared 
her with his talk of living with dead people. 

",['Ron']
"I borrowed 
it from Kreacher,” she explained as Ron raised his 
eyebrows.",['Ron']
"Apparently the Peverells 
were one of the earliest families to vanish.” 

“ ‘Extinct in the male line’?” repeated Ron.

"“Sorry?” said Ron and Hermione together. 

",['Ron']
With Dumbledore!,['Dumbledore']
"Page | 482 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




Ron and Hermione looked bewildered. 



",['Ron']
"Ron was looking from one to the 
other, astonished. 

",['Ron']
"He looked at Ron 
for support.",['Ron']
"“What if it was the Resurrection Stone?” 

Ron’s mouth fell open. 

",['Ron']
"“Blimey — but would it still work if Dumbledore broke 
— ?” 

“Work?",['Dumbledore']
"Ron, it never worked!",['Ron']
"Ron asked 
Harry.",['Ron']
"“What did Dumbledore do with it after he 
broke it open?” 

",['Dumbledore']
"But Harry’s imagination was racing ahead, far beyond 
Ron and Hermione ’s. ... 

",['Ron']
"And then, with a gasp, he remembered — 

“Dumbledore had my Cloak the night my parents 
died!” 

",['Dumbledore']
"“My mum told Sirius that Dumbledore borrowed the 
Cloak!",['Dumbledore']
"Dumbledore had the Cloak, 
Hermione!",['Dumbledore']
"He could not understand why Ron looked taken 
aback.",['Ron']
"Page | 486 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




The change in his voice made Ron and Hermione look 
even more scared. 

",['Ron']
"Harry 
walked to the entrance of the tent, forgetting about 
Ron and Hermione as he looked out into the night, 
thinking. ... 

",['Ron']
"It was a shock to see 
Ron and Hermione standing exactly where he had left 
them, Hermione still holding Lily’s letter, Ron at her 
side looking slightly anxious.",['Ron']
"Please,” she said as he 
started to speak, “please just answer me this: If the 
Deathly Hallows really existed, and Dumbledore knew 
about them, knew that the person who possessed all 
three of them would be master of Death — Harry, why 
wouldn’t he have told you?",['Dumbledore']
"“Dumbledore usually let me find out stuff for myself. 
",['Dumbledore']
"This is 
the real thing, and Dumbledore left you very clear 
instructions: Find and destroy the Horcruxes!",['Dumbledore']
"She appealed to Ron. 

",['Ron']
"Ron hesitated. 

",['Ron']
"I mean ... bits of it sort of fit together,” 
said Ron awkwardly.",['Ron']
"That’s what 
Dumbledore told us to do.",['Dumbledore']
"“Thank you, Ron,” said Hermione.",['Ron']
"If only he had the 
stone, he could ask Dumbledore these questions in 
person . . .",['Dumbledore']
"It was as though a flame had been 
lit inside him that nothing, not Hermione ’s flat 
disbelief nor Ron’s persistent doubts, could 
extinguish.",['Ron']
"He blamed Ron and Hermione: Their determined 
indifference was as bad as the relentless rain for 
dampening his spirits, but neither could erode his 
certainty, which remained absolute.",['Ron']
"We’re the ones trying 
to do what Dumbledore wanted us to do!” 

",['Dumbledore']
"Dumbledore had left the sign of the Hallows for 
Hermione to decipher, and he had also, Harry 
remained convinced of it, left the Resurrection Stone 
hidden in the golden Snitch.",['Dumbledore']
"Why didn’t Ron 
and Hermione understand? 



",['Ron']
"As the weeks crept on, Harry could not help but 
notice, even through his new self-absorption, that 
Ron seemed to be taking charge.",['Ron']
"Perhaps because he 
was determined to make up for having walked out on 
them, perhaps because Harry’s descent into 
listlessness galvanized his dormant leadership 
qualities, Ron was the one now encouraging and 
exhorting the other two into action. 



",['Ron']
"The orphanage ...” 

Diagon Alley, Hogwarts, the Riddle House, Borgin and 
Burkes, Albania, every place that they knew Tom 
Riddle had ever lived or worked, visited or murdered, 
Ron and Hermione raked over them again, Harry 
joining in only to stop Hermione pestering him.",['Ron']
"He 
would have been happy to sit alone in silence, trying 
to read Voldemort’s thoughts, to find out more about 
the Elder Wand, but Ron insisted on journeying to 
ever more unlikely places simply, Harry was aware, to 
keep them moving. 

",['Ron']
"“You never know,” was Ron’s constant refrain.",['Ron']
"“Some of them are supposed to be as bad as Death 
Eaters,” said Ron.",['Ron']
"Ron spent evening after evening using his wand to 
beat out various rhythms on top of the wireless while 
the dials whirled.",['Ron']
"While he tapped, Ron continued to try to hit on 
the correct password, muttering strings of random 
words under his breath. 

",['Ron']
But not until March did luck favor Ron at last.,['Ron']
"Harry 
was sitting in the tent entrance, on guard duty, 
staring idly at a clump of grape hyacinths that had 
forced their way through the chilly ground, when Ron 
shouted excitedly from inside the tent. 

",['Ron']
"Roused for the first time in days from his 
contemplation of the Deathly Hallows, Harry hurried 
back inside the tent to find Ron and Hermione 
kneeling on the floor beside the little radio.",['Ron']
“I know!” beamed Ron.,['Ron']
"“Hi.” 

“Evening, River.” 

“ ‘River,’ that’s Lee,” Ron explained.",['Ron']
"He, Ron, and 
Hermione gazed at one another in horror. 

",['Ron']
"Silence fell, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione did not 
speak.",['Ron']
"“Kingsley!” burst out Ron. 

",['Ron']
"“Thanks, River,” said another very familiar voice; Ron 
started to speak, but Hermione forestalled him in a 
whisper. 

",['Ron']
"“We know it’s Lupin\” 

“Romulus, do you maintain, as you have every time 
you’ve appeared on our program, that Harry Potter is 
still alive?” 

“I do,” said Lupin firmly.",['Lupin']
"Had Lupin forgiven him, then, for the terrible things 
he had said when they had last met? 

",['Lupin']
"“I’d tell him we’re all with him in spirit,” said Lupin, 
then hesitated slightly.",['Lupin']
"“Oh, didn’t I tell you?” said Ron in surprise.",['Ron']
"“Bill told 
me Lupin’s living with Tonks again!",['Lupin']
"“Well, as regular listeners will know, several of the 
more outspoken supporters of Harry Potter have now 
been imprisoned, including Xenophilius Lovegood, 
erstwhile editor of The Quibbler,” said Lupin. 

",['Lupin']
"muttered Ron. 

",['Ron']
"“We have also heard within the last few hours that 
Rubeus Hagrid” — all three of them gasped, and so 
nearly missed the rest of the sentence — “well-known 
gamekeeper at Hogwarts School, has narrowly 
escaped arrest within the grounds of Hogwarts, where 
he is rumored to have hosted a ‘Support Harry Potter’ 
party in his house.",['Hagrid']
"However, Hagrid was not taken 
into custody, and is, we believe, on the run.” 

",['Hagrid']
"Page | 498 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - J.K. Rowling 




“It would tend to give you an edge,” agreed Lupin 
gravely.",['Lupin']
"“May I just add that while we here at 
Potterwatch applaud Hagrid’s spirit, we would urge 
even the most devoted of Harry’s supporters against 
following Hagrid’s lead.",['Hagrid']
"We like 
to refer to him as the Chief Death Eater, and here to 
give his views on some of the more insane rumors 
circulating about him, I’d like to introduce a new 
correspondent: Rodent.” 

“ ‘Rodent’?” said yet another familiar voice, and Harry, 
Ron, and Hermione cried out together: 

“Fred!” 

",['Ron']
"“It’s Fred, I think,” said Ron, leaning in closer, as 
whichever twin it was said, 

“I’m not being ‘Rodent,’ no way, I told you I wanted to 
be ‘Rapier’!” 

",['Ron']
"Maybe he 
is, maybe he isn’t, but the fact remains he can move 
faster than Severus Snape confronted with shampoo 
when he wants to, so don’t count on him being a long 
way away if you’re planning on taking any risks.",['Snape']
"Harry, Ron, and Hermione 
were still beaming.",['Ron']
"“Good, eh?” said Ron happily. 

",['Ron']
"“If they were found ...” 

“Well, they keep on the move, don’t they?” said Ron. 
“Like us.” 

",['Ron']
"Ron bellowed, leaping to his feet 
as a loud crack sounded outside the tent.",['Ron']
"But Ron stopped talking, and Harry knew why.",['Ron']
"Ron pulled the 
Deluminator out of his pocket and clicked it: Their 
lamps went out. 

",['Ron']
"His eyes had 
been reduced to slits through which he could barely 
see; his glasses fell off as he was bundled out of the 
tent; all he could make out were the blurred shapes of 
four or five people wrestling Ron and Hermione 
outside too. 

",['Ron']
Ron shouted.,['Ron']
"There was the 
unmistakable sound of knuckles hitting flesh: Ron 
grunted in pain and Hermione screamed, “No! Leave 
him alone, leave him alone!” 

",['Ron']
"A thud 
told him that Ron had been cast down beside him. 
",['Ron']
"“Check the list, Scabior,” said Greyback, and Harry 
heard him move sideways to look down at Ron, 
instead.",['Ron']
"“Stan Shunpike,” said Ron. 

“Like ’ell you are,” said the man called Scabior.",['Ron']
"“I’b Bardy,” said Ron, and Harry could tell that his 
mouth was full of blood.",['Ron']
"“But the ’ole lot 
of ’em look like they could still be ’ogwarts age — ” 

“Weh lebt,” said Ron. 

",['Ron']
"“Nod a laugh,” said Ron.",['Ron']
"“No,” said Ron and Hermione from either side of him. 

",['Ron']
"Greyback smelled as he had done at the top of 
the tower where Dumbledore had died: of dirt, sweat, 
and blood. 

",['Dumbledore']
"With a huge effort of will Harry closed his mind to 
Voldemort’s thoughts, pulling himself back to where 
he sat, tied to Ron, Hermione, Dean, and Griphook in 
the darkness, listening to Greyback and Scabior. 



",['Ron']
"Harry struggled, trying to throw off Greyback’s hand, 
but it was hopeless: Ron and Hermione were 
squeezed tightly against him on either side, he could 
not separate from the group, and as the breath was 
squeezed out of him his scar seared more painfully 
still — 

— as he forced himself through the slit of a window 
like a snake and landed, lightly as vapor, inside the 
cell-like room — 

The prisoners lurched into one another as they 
landed in a country lane.",['Ron']
"Ere, ma’am — ” 

Through his puffy eyelids Harry saw Narcissa Malfoy 
scrutinizing his swollen face.",['Malfoy']
"The dreadfully familiar, drawling voice of Lucius 
Malfoy fell on Harry’s ears.",['Malfoy']
"“Well, Draco?” said Lucius Malfoy.",['Malfoy']
"Harry had never heard Lucius Malfoy so excited. 

",['Malfoy']
"“Draco, if we are the ones who hand Potter over to the 
Dark Lord, everything will be forgiv — ”

striding around the bound prisoners to face Ron.",['Ron']

and struggle against the ropes tying them together, so 
that Harry staggered.",['Ron']

work out a way — ” 



",['Ron']
"“Ron? 
Is that you?” 

",['Ron']
Ron stopped shouting.,['Ron']

“Luna?”

Hermione screamed again from overhead, and they 
could hear Bellatrix screaming too, but her words 
were inaudible, for Ron shouted again, “HERMIONE!

Ollivander, have you got the nail?",['Mr.']

screamed again; Ron struggled harder than ever, and

what I’m doing — ”

and she began hacking at their bindings again.

wrists, to see Ron running around the cellar, looking 
up at the low ceiling, searching for a trapdoor.",['Ron']

fruitless efforts.",['Ron']

a long time, he’s tried everything.”

Hermione ’s screams echoed off the walls upstairs, 

Ron was half sobbing as he pounded the walls with 
his fists, and Harry in utter desperation seized 
Hagrid’s pouch from around his neck and groped 
inside it: He pulled out Dumbledore’s Snitch and

shook it, hoping for he did not know what — nothing 
happened — he waved the broken halves of the 
phoenix wand, but they were lifeless — the mirror 
fragment fell sparkling to the floor, and he saw a

upward; Harry slapped a hand to his mouth, muffling 
his voice.",['Ron']

above.

her with the wands, “Cissy, I think we ought to tie 
these little heroes up again, while Greyback takes 
care of Miss Mudblood.",['Miss']
"As Ron ran to pull Hermione out of the wreckage, 
Harry took his chance: He leapt over an armchair and 
wrested the three wands from Draco’s grip, pointed all 
of them at Greyback, and yelled, “Stupefyl” The 
werewolf was lifted off his feet by the triple spell, flew 
up to the ceiling, and then smashed to the ground.

"As he turned into darkness he caught one last view of 
the drawing room: of the pale, frozen figures of 
Narcissa and Draco, of the streak of red that was 
Ron’s hair, and a blur of flying silver, as Bellatrix’s 
knife flew across the room at the place where he was 
vanishing —

THE WANDMAKER 

It was like sinking into an old nightmare; for an 
instant Harry knelt again beside Dumbledore’s body 
at the foot of the tallest tower at Hogwarts, but in 
reality he was staring at a tiny body curled upon the 
grass, pierced by Bellatrix’s silver knife.",['Dumbledore']
"“Where is she?” 

“Ron’s taken her inside,” said Bill.",['Ron']
"As 
he did so, he gazed down at the tiny body, and his 
scar prickled and burned, and in one part of his 
mind, viewed as if from the wrong end of a long 
telescope, he saw Voldemort punishing those they 
had left behind at Malfoy Manor.",['Malfoy']
"He had learned control at 
last, learned to shut his mind to Voldemort, the very 
thing Dumbledore had wanted him to learn from 
Snape.","['Snape', 'Dumbledore']"
"though Dumbledore, of course, 
would have said that it was love.",['Dumbledore']
"Dumbledore 
had foreseen that.",['Dumbledore']
"He knew only that the 
darkness had lightened a few degrees when he was 
rejoined by Ron and Dean. 

",['Ron']
"“How’s Hermione?” 

“Better,” said Ron.",['Ron']
"Ron 
sat on the edge of the grave and stripped off his shoes 
and socks, which he placed upon the elf’s bare feet. 
",['Ron']
"Hermione was wrapped in a borrowed dressing gown, 
pale and unsteady on her feet; Ron put an arm 
around her when she reached him.",['Ron']
"He forced himself not to break down as he 
remembered Dumbledore’s funeral, and the rows and 
rows of golden chairs, and the Minister of Magic in 
the front row, the recitation of Dumbledore’s 
achievements, the stateliness of the white marble 
tomb.",['Dumbledore']
"She turned and looked expectantly at Ron, who 
cleared his throat and said in a thick voice, “Yeah ... 
thanks, Dobby.”

"The Death Eaters 
know Ron’s with you now, they’re bound to target the 
family — don’t apologize,” he added at the sight of 
Harry’s expression.",['Ron']

Dumbledore in Harry’s head smiled, surveying Harry 
over the tips of his fingers, pressed together as if in 
prayer.

"What did you know about 
me, Dumbledore? 

",['Dumbledore']
"“You 
turn up here with a dead house-elf and a half- 
conscious goblin, Hermione looks as though she’s 
been tortured, and Ron’s just refused to tell me 
anything — ” 

“We can’t tell you what we’re doing,” said Harry flatly. 
",['Ron']
"“You’re in the Order, Bill, you know Dumbledore left 
us a mission.",['Dumbledore']

Hermione, who had been skulking, half concealed, in 
the doorway of the sitting room. 

",['Ron']
"“You were 
amazing — coming up with that story when she was 
hurting you like that — ” 

Hermione gave a weak smile as Ron gave her a one- 
armed squeeze.

stairs onto a small landing.",['Ron']

chair beside the dressing table; Ron sat on the arm.

"Ron and Hermione were 
staring at Harry as though he had gone mad. 

",['Ron']
"“No, it isn’t,” Ron contradicted him.",['Ron']
"He saw Hermione and Ron look at each other, 
astonished, but there would be time enough to 
explain after Griphook had given his answer. 

",['Ron']
"“Well, goblins can do magic without wands,” said 
Ron. 

",['Ron']
"“Well, goblins won’t share any of their magic either,” 
said Ron.",['Ron']

the arm of Hermione’s chair.)",['Ron']

again.

the ribs.

“But I thought we were looking for places You-Know- 
Who’s been, places he’s done something important?” 
said Ron, looking baffled.",['Ron']
"Harry’s scar throbbed, but he ignored it; he wanted 
Ron and Hermione to understand about Gringotts

"He never told Lucius Malfoy the 
truth about the diary.",['Malfoy']

head.

understood Dumbledore as much.",['Dumbledore']

as they followed him across the little landing and 
knocked upon the door opposite Bill and Fleur’s.",['Ron']

the empty bed, beside Ron and Hermione.",['Ron']

Harry.",['Malfoy']

Wormtail’s wand out of his pocket and handing it to 
Ollivander. 

",['Ron']
"“You ask deep questions, Mr. 

Potter.",['Mr.']
"“I — how?” croaked Ollivander, and he looked 
appealingly at Ron and Hermione for help.",['Ron']

reproachful look, and said, “Let’s not worry about 
that now — ”

for your destruction, Mr. Potter.",['Mr. Potter']

He led Ron and Hermione down the staircase.,['Ron']
"They all looked up at Harry as he appeared 
in the doorway, but he merely nodded to them and 
continued into the garden, Ron and Hermione behind 
him.",['Ron']
"He must make only one more short 
effort, so that he could explain to Ron and Hermione. 

",['Ron']
"And at the height of his power, when 
Dumbledore knew he was the only one who could 
stop him, he dueled Grindelwald and beat him, and 
he took the Elder Wand.”

to have it.",['Dumbledore']

barely visible over the horizon as he glided alongside 
Snape, up through the grounds toward the lake. 

",['Snape']
"Snape bowed and set off back up the path, his black 
cloak billowing behind him.",['Snape']

do for Snape, or indeed anyone else, to see where he 
was going.",['Snape']

upon his chest, and there it lay, clutched beneath 
them, buried with him. 

",['Dumbledore']
"The spiderlike 
hand swooped and pulled the wand from 
Dumbledore’s grasp, and as he took it, a shower of 
sparks flew from its tip, sparkling over the corpse of 
its last owner, ready to serve a new master at last. 



",['Dumbledore']
"He was full of doubts, 
doubts that Ron could not help voicing whenever they 
were together. 

",['Ron']
"“What if Dumbledore wanted us to work out the 
symbol in time to get the wand?”",['Dumbledore']
"The odd thing was that Hermione’s support made him 
feel just as confused as Ron’s doubts.",['Ron']
"“You couldn’t have broken into 
Dumbledore’s grave.” 

",['Dumbledore']
"But the idea of Dumbledore’s corpse frightened Harry 
much less than the possibility that he might have 
misunderstood the living Dumbledore’s intentions.",['Dumbledore']
"From time to time, 
anger at Dumbledore crashed over him again, 
powerful as the waves slamming themselves against 
the cliff beneath the cottage, anger that Dumbledore 
had not explained before he died. 

",['Dumbledore']
"“But is he dead?” said Ron, three days after they had 
arrived at the cottage.",['Ron']

over the wall that separated the cottage garden from

wished they had not, having no wish to join in with 
their argument.

across Harry, who continued to gaze at the horizon. 
",['Ron']
"“But you don’t think you did, do you?” asked Ron.

"“There you go!” said Ron quickly, before Hermione 
could carry on.",['Ron']
"“If it wasn’t Dumbledore, explain how 
Dobby knew we were in the cellar, Hermione?” 

",['Dumbledore']

him to us if he’s lying in a tomb at Hogwarts?”

Harry.",['Dumbledore']
"There was little about Dumbledore he was sure 
of now, but he knew that much.",['Dumbledore']

Harry could say any more, a voice behind them said, “ 
’Arry?” 

",['Ron']
"“We can give you something else,” said Ron eagerly. 
",['Ron']
"“No one’s,” said Ron.",['Ron']
"“No!” cried the goblin, bristling with anger as he 
pointed a long finger at Ron.",['Ron']
"Behind him, Ron said, “He’s having a laugh.",['Ron']
"“Wizarding history 
often skates over what the wizards have done to other 
magical races, but there’s no account that I know of 
that says Gryffindor stole the sword.”

how the wizards are always trying to get one over on 
them.",['Ron']
"“Goblins have got good reason to dislike wizards, 

Ron,” said Hermione.",['Ron']

“how’s this?",['Ron']

again.",['Ron']

that he could question him; his fault that the whole

in the making!”

life, and Hagrid standing beside him saying, “ Like I 
said, yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it.”",['Hagrid']

pulled her to her feet, but to Harry’s horror he saw 
that she was no longer Bellatrix; instead she stood 
there in overlarge robes, sopping wet and completely 
herself; Ron was red-haired and beardless again.

expression changing to one of polite indifference, as

they hurried on foot into the darkness after the 
goblin, Bogrod panting in their wake like an old dog.

astride him, Harry dived and caught it, and although 
he could feel it scalding his flesh he did not relinquish

his fist, raining down upon him as the entrance of the 
vault opened up again and he found himself sliding 
uncontrollably on an expanding avalanche of fiery 
gold and silver that bore him, Ron, and Hermione into 
the outer chamber.

in: Jets of red light flew into the crowd of goblins, and

saw several wizard guards running around the 
corner.

out an arm; Hermione hoisted herself up; Ron

crashing of rock and the dragon’s roars, he could only 
cling to its back, expecting to be shaken off at any 
moment; then he heard Hermione yelling, “Defodiol”

carving out the ceiling as it struggled upward toward 
the fresher air, away from the shrieking and clanking

ceiling apart with more gouging spells.",['Ron']

could smell beyond the entrance, it took off, and with

staggered into Diagon Alley and launched itself into 
the sky.

delight or fear he could not tell, Ron kept swearing at

threw others behind them in their race for the door, 
and again and again his wand fell, and those who 
were left were slain, all of them, for bringing him this 
news, for hearing about the golden cup — 

Alone amongst the dead he stormed up and down, 
and they passed before him in vision: his treasures, 
his safeguards, his anchors to immortality — the 
diary was destroyed and the cup was stolen: What if, 
what if, the boy knew about the others?",['Malfoy']

",['Dumbledore']
"Dumbledore, who had always suspected him; 
Dumbledore, dead on his orders; Dumbledore, whose 
wand was his now, yet who reached out from the 
ignominy of death through the boy, the boy —

Horcruxes, he, Lord Voldemort, would have known, 
would have felt it?",['Dumbledore']
"He, the greatest wizard of them all; 
he, the most powerful; he, the killer of Dumbledore

attacked, mutilated?

worried.

familiar Hogsmeade High Street: dark shop fronts,

village, and the curve in the road ahead that led off 
toward Hogwarts, and light spilling from the windows 
of the Three Broomsticks, and with a lurch of the 
heart he remembered, with piercing accuracy, how he 
had landed here nearly a year before, supporting a 
desperately weak Dumbledore; all this in a second, 
upon landing — and then, even as he relaxed his grip 
upon Ron’s and Hermione’s arms, it happened.

hidden.

little, keeping his eyes fixed upon Nagini, wondering 
whether there was any spell that might penetrate the 
protection surrounding her, but he could not think of 
anything.",['Snape']
"“My Lord?” said Snape. 

",['Snape']
“My — my Lord?” said Snape blankly.,['Snape']

"Harry could not see his face: He 
wondered whether Snape sensed danger, was trying 
to find the right words to reassure his master. 

",['Snape']
"And for a moment Harry saw Snape ’s profile: His eyes 
were fixed upon the coiling snake in its enchanted 
cage. 

",['Snape']
"Voldemort halted, and Harry could see him plainly 
again as he slid the Elder Wand through his white 
fingers, staring at Snape. 



",['Snape']
"He closed his 
eyes, and suddenly he was Voldemort, looking into 
Snape’s pale face.

through the air, and before Snape could do anything 
more than yell, it had encased him, head and 
shoulders, and Voldemort spoke in Parseltongue.

"Harry saw Snape ’s face 
losing the little color it had left; it whitened as his 
black eyes widened, as the snake’s fangs pierced his

neck, as he failed to push the enchanted cage off 
himself, as his knees gave way and he fell to the floor. 

",['Snape']

snake, which drifted upward, off Snape, who fell 
sideways onto the floor, blood gushing from the 
wounds in his neck.",['Snape']

approaching the dying man: He did not know what he 
felt as he saw Snape’s white face, and the fingers 
trying to staunch the bloody wound at his neck.

"Harry bent over 
him, and Snape seized the front of his robes and 
pulled him close.

full to the brim, and Snape looked as though there

THE PRINCE’S TALE 

Harry remained kneeling at Snape’s side, simply 
staring down at him, until quite suddenly a high, cold 
voice spoke so close to them that Harry jumped to his 
feet, the flask gripped tightly in his hands, thinking 
that Voldemort had reentered the room.

looking at Harry.

up the Invisibility Cloak, then looked down at Snape.

"He did not know what to feel, except shock at the way 
Snape had been killed, and the reason for which it 
had been done.",['Snape']

Hermione could still hear Voldemort ringing in their 
heads, as he could.

crystal flask of Snape’s last thoughts, and he did not 
slow down until he reached the stone gargoyle 
guarding the headmaster’s office.

it was he whom he yearned to see, and to his surprise

behind.

frame, which hung directly behind the headmaster’s 
chair, then turned his back on it.",['Dumbledore']

removed his coat now; his odd smock looked less

resembled him.",['Snape']

shown no interest at all in Lily or Snape until that 
point, looked around at the word, and Harry, whose 
attention had been focused entirely on the two beside 
the window, saw his father: slight, black-haired like 
Snape, but with that indefinable air of having been 
well-cared-for, even adored, that Snape so 
conspicuously lacked.
