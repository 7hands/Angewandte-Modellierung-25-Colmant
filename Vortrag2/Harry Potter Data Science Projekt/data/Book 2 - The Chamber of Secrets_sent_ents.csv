caving —

Lockhart coming down a corridor.",['Lockhart']
"Hedwig was still angry with Harry about the 
disasterous car journey and Ron’s wand was still 
malfunctioning, surpassing itself on Friday morning

tiny old Professor Flitwick squarely between the eyes, 
creating a large, throbbing green boil where it had 
struck.","['Flitwick', 'Ron']"

staircase to the common room, his Nimbus Two 
Thousand on his shoulder.",['Ron']

on an arm Harry recognized as his own.",['Lockhart']

words.",['Malfoy']

pulled out his wand, yelling, “You’ll pay for that one,

Malfoy’s face.

in, come in — thought you mighta bin Professor

threshold into the one-roomed cabin, which had an 
enormous bed in one corner, a fire crackling merrily 
in the other.","['Lockhart', 'Ron']"

over the basin.",['Ron']

best man for the job — ”

coughed squelchily into his basin.","['Hagrid', 'Dumbledore', 'Ron']"

do,” said Hagrid proudly, making Hermione go a

against the back wall of the cabin.",['Hagrid']

THE ROGUE BLUDGER 

Since the disastrous episode of the pixies, Professor 
Lockhart had not brought live creatures to class. 
",['Lockhart']
"He usually picked Harry to help him with these 
reconstructions; so far, Harry had been forced to play 
a simple Transylvanian villager whom Lockhart had 
cured of a Babbling Curse, a yeti with a head cold, 
and a vampire who had been unable to eat anything 
except lettuce since Lockhart had dealt with him. 

",['Lockhart']
"If he hadn’t had a very good 
reason for keeping Lockhart in a good mood, he would 
have refused to do it. 

",['Lockhart']
"The bell rang and Lockhart got to his feet. 

",['Lockhart']
"Harry returned to the back 
of the room, where Ron and Hermione were waiting. 

",['Ron']
"“All right ...” 

She approached Lockhart’s desk, a piece of paper 
clutched tightly in her hand, Harry and Ron right 
behind her. 

","['Lockhart', 'Ron']"
“Er — Professor Lockhart?”,['Lockhart']
"“But the thing is, 
it’s in the Restricted Section of the library, so I need a 
teacher to sign for it — I’m sure it would help me 
understand what you say in Gadding with Ghouls 
about slow-acting venoms — ” 

“Ah, Gadding with GhoulsV’ said Lockhart, taking the 
note from Hermione and smiling widely at her. 
",['Lockhart']
"“So clever, the way 
you trapped that last one with the tea-strainer — ” 

“Well, I’m sure no one will mind me giving the best 
student of the year a little extra help,” said Lockhart 
warmly, and he pulled out an enormous peacock 
quill.",['Lockhart']
"he said, misreading the 
revolted look on Ron’s face.",['Ron']
"“So, Harry,” said Lockhart, while Hermione folded the 
note with fumbling fingers and slipped it into her bag. 
",['Lockhart']
"...” 

Harry made an indistinct noise in his throat and then 
hurried off after Ron and Hermione. 

",['Ron']
"“That’s because he’s a brainless git,” said Ron.",['Ron']
"“Oh, come on,” said Ron, wrenching it from her grasp 
and thrusting it at Madam Pince.",['Ron']
"Lockhart ’ll sign anything if it 
stands still long enough.” 

",['Lockhart']
"Hermione 
had overridden Ron’s objections by pointing out that 
it was the last place anyone in their right minds 
would go, so they were guaranteed some privacy.

“Excuse me?” said Ron sharply.,['Ron']
"...” 

Ron turned, speechless, to Harry, who had another 
worry. 

",['Ron']
"What’re we 
going to do, break into Snape’s private stores?",['Snape']
"But if you don’t want to find out if it’s Malfoy, I’ll go 
straight to Madam Pince now and hand the book back 
in — ” 



“I never thought I’d see the day when you’d be 
persuading us to break rules,” said Ron.","['Malfoy', 'Ron']"
“A month?” said Ron.,['Ron']
"“Malfoy could have attacked 
half the Muggle-borns in the school by then!”",['Malfoy']
"However, while Hermione was checking that the coast 
was clear for them to leave the bathroom, Ron 
muttered to Harry, “It’ll be a lot less hassle if you can 
just knock Malfoy off his broom tomorrow.”

over to wish Harry good luck as he entered the locker 
rooms.",['Ron']

day they let that little bit of slime, Malfoy, buy his 
way onto their team.”

Harry, because we’ve got to win today, we’ve got to.”

underneath him as though to show off the speed of 
his broom. 

",['Malfoy']
"Harry dropped quickly to avoid it, and George 
managed to hit it hard toward Malfoy.",['Malfoy']
"“Training for the ballet, Potter?” yelled Malfoy as 
Harry was forced to do a stupid kind of twirl in midair 
to dodge the Bludger, and he fled, the Bludger trailing 
a few feet behind him; and then, glaring back at

"It 
was hovering inches above Malfoy’s left ear — and 
Malfoy, busy laughing at Harry, hadn’t seen it. 

",['Malfoy']
"For an agonizing moment, Harry hung in midair, not 
daring to speed toward Malfoy in case he looked up 
and saw the Snitch. 

WHAM. 

",['Malfoy']
"Dimly, dazed by the searing 
pain in his arm, he slid sideways on his rain- 
drenched broom, one knee still crooked over it, his 
right arm dangling useless at his side — the Bludger 
came pelting back for a second attack, this time 
aiming at his face — Harry swerved out of the way, 
one idea firmly lodged in his numb brain: get to 
Malfoy. 

",['Malfoy']
"Through a haze of rain and pain he dived for the 
shimmering, sneering face below him and saw its eyes 
widen with fear: Malfoy thought Harry was attacking 
him. 

",['Malfoy']
"“Doesn’t know what he’s saying,” said Lockhart loudly 
to the anxious crowd of Gryffindors pressing around 
them.",['Lockhart']
"“Lie back, Harry,” said Lockhart soothingly.",['Lockhart']
"“Stand back,” said Lockhart, who was rolling up his 
jade-green sleeves. 

",['Lockhart']
"“No — don’t — ” said Harry weakly, but Lockhart was 
twirling his wand and a second later had directed it 
straight at Harry’s arm. 

",['Lockhart']

"So, Harry, 
just toddle up to the hospital wing — ah, Mr. 

Weasley, Miss Granger, would you escort him?",['Miss Granger']

Harry’s bed while Ron helped him into his pajamas.",['Ron']

eh?”",['Lockhart']

Harry’s limp fingers through the cuff.",['Ron']

inept teachers, Madam Pomfrey retreated, leaving Ron 
and Hermione to help Harry gulp down some water.

his face.",['Ron']

face ...",['Malfoy']

seen Marcus Flint yelling at Malfoy.",['Malfoy']

nightcap.",['Dumbledore']

later, carrying its feet.",['McGonagall']

attacker?” said Professor McGonagall eagerly.

this any better than he did.

there.",['Ron']

McGonagall came around as usual, collecting names

Christmas.",['McGonagall']

they had heard that Malfoy was staying, which struck 
them as very suspicious.","['Malfoy', 'Ron']"

still needed the bicorn horn and the boomslang skin,

from Snape’s private stores.",['Snape']

rather face Slytherin’s legendary monster than let 
Snape catch him robbing his office.

office and take what we need.”

Snape’s Potions class was about as safe as poking a

Gryffindors’ work while the Slytherins sniggered 
appreciatively.",['Snape']

swell like a balloon; Goyle blundered around, his 
hands over his eyes, which had expanded to the size

confusion, Harry saw Hermione slip quietly into

up lips, Harry saw Hermione slide back into the 
dungeon, the front of her robes bulging.
